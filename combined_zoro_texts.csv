1,for the sake of beatitude worship rud ra serve him with salutes he is both the deva god of the hindus and the aura ahura god of the parsis rud ra is one he does not tolerate a second.,vedic_gathas
2,mazda alone is the adorable most marat marat constitutes the a sura hood divinity of all the divas be all the worlds know him and they give to varuna a attain that by conscience by rectitude and by love.,vedic_gathas
3,the name vedhas mazda.,vedic_gathas
4,by love distinct from mere obedience.,vedic_gathas
5,a be when in india vishnu approached indra for the sake of communion the greater one assimilated the great a one vedhas mazda won over the aryans of trisha bac tri a media and per si a and led the devotee to recti a him the bantu vaishya worships him the verbena eye of kshatriya and the andaman brahmin worship him thu i divas too worship.,vedic_gathas
6,in my mind there is naught but the a love of ahura mazda.,vedic_gathas
7,a through the concrete love of the friend the he the ahura lords it over the divas the authority of brother the father.,vedic_gathas
8,a a a oh ahura mazda you are the friend the brother and the father of them all.,vedic_gathas
9,a in ecstasy.,vedic_gathas
10,when shall mazda walk along with you and how will your ecstasy be mine tell me that i would discharge the duties of both the deva aha deva yas na and the pitch ana mazda yasna.,vedic_gathas
11,oh ahura now i dedicate this one to you.,vedic_gathas
12,then brahma bowed down to glorious hard medhas ahura~mazda and learnt from him the best religion with all its principles and secrets hard medhas ahura mazda is the soul of consciousness and the root of knowledge.,vedic_gathas
13,he is both personal and in personal and one who always views the world we bow a ea ripening to him.,vedic_gathas
14,rectitude is the greatest good.,vedic_gathas
15,the good does exist the good consists in this that rectitude should be for the sake of great rectitude.,vedic_gathas
16,virtue for the sake of virtue and not for the sake of anything else like pleasure fame etc is the end of life.,vedic_gathas
17,rectitude is the first step towards god realisation for in rectitude is the first manifestation of mazda.,vedic_gathas
18,just as god is to be adored so is the prophet and that by means of rectitude alone the prophet who is the upholder of a conscience for the sake of the deeds of life towards mazda and of a nonchalance in the cause of the lord and whom the lord appointed as the saviour of the pious.,vedic_gathas
19,the prophets the highest manifestation of ged.,vedic_gathas
20,by emulating him we can acquire godly virtues rectitude is the only means of serving god.,vedic_gathas
21,other deeds have only subsidiary value.. for rectitude two factors are necessary: a conscience to point out the duty a nonchalance to give the strength to stick to duty.,vedic_gathas
22,by inculcating these two root principles the prophet is saviour of mankind may the ame sha spent as sacred institutes accept the gathas.,vedic_gathas
23,salutation to the sacred gathas.,vedic_gathas
24,the ame sha spent as sacred institutes are the laws rand the stages of the spiritual life.,vedic_gathas
25,without knowing the meaning of the meshes it snot possible to understand the gathas.,vedic_gathas
26,the soul of the world wailed unto you wherefore did you create me?,vedic_gathas
27,who is it that fashioned me?,vedic_gathas
28,greed and violence oppress me insolence and rapine assail me i have no protector other than you.,vedic_gathas
29,so direct me toa safe shelter.,vedic_gathas
30,the problem of evil is the main problem of religion.,vedic_gathas
31,a god is kind why is there such misery in the world a if has not kind what is the good of worshipping him a the ga tha starts with this moot point ﻿the world were not narrow why is all this lamentation?,vedic_gathas
32,why does one become more bent with grief the longer he lives in the world then the creator of the world mazda asked asia rectitude where is thy prophet for the world who capable world fosterer and vigorous would sustain her always a whom do you intend as her lord as one who can thwart the violence of the wicked a the end of life is if pleasure is the only end then righteous ness has no place in the economy of life for righteousness a consists in resisting the temptations of pleasure.,vedic_gathas
33,so the a matter is referred to asia rectitude a virtue and vice cannot have the same consequences though the virtuous apparently suffer they are going nearer to mazda and would attain perfect happiness at the end.,vedic_gathas
34,only a prophet can induce this conviction and a a an enquiry is made about the prophet.,vedic_gathas
35,the problem of evilleads to the question as to what a re to him replied asia there is in the world not hero who is himself free from arrogance.,vedic_gathas
36,of them i know not one who can make the lowly great.,vedic_gathas
37,of these beings he is the real worthy to whom the call of duty reaches asia replies that there is.,vedic_gathas
38,no one perfectly righteous yet that is not a matter for utter despair.,vedic_gathas
39,for if one sincerely tries to walk in the path of duty that is enough to bring him redemption.,vedic_gathas
40,misery and pain do not sway him.,vedic_gathas
41,no one is free from fault: if one sticks to duty that's enough merit.,vedic_gathas
42,hereafter he ahura is the judge thereof.,vedic_gathas
43,let it be unto us as he wills heretofore he took orders from the king a thereafter he could give commands to the soldiers a mazdaalone is the most adorable.,vedic_gathas
44,whatever has been done heretofore by men and divas or will be done the source of all this however is in the gatha.,vedic_gathas
45,this risk also jays down the ultimate lesson of religion viz complete surrender to the will of god.,vedic_gathas
46,man is not left to his own resources alone.,vedic_gathas
47,we did not create ourselves and there is a wise judge at the head of the affairs of the world.,vedic_gathas
48,it is prudent to leave the matter of rectifying the wrongs to him and submit to his decision ethics leads to religion for mazda is the source of rectitude.,vedic_gathas
49,if man had not been made what he is if he had not been provided with conscience he would not have made any distinction between the right and the wrong there would not have been any course of duty for him just as there is none for the beasts so we must look to a the source and learn that mazda is the sole adorable rend my garment if you would.,vedic_gathas
50,there sone who he alone can rectify evil.,vedic_gathas
51,willow it.,vedic_gathas
52,if cannot count upon mazda sewing it it is better that i should give up all thoughts of mending and go about naked for my own efforts are ineffectual.,vedic_gathas
53,then so with out stretched hands invoking the grace of the lord my.,vedic_gathas
54,soul and that of the living world approached mazda with this request may there not be adversity for the honest nor prosperity for the dishonest.,vedic_gathas
55,virtue does not necessarily lead to adversity and vice does not necessarily bring in prosperity.,vedic_gathas
56,the worldly standard course of virtue.,vedic_gathas
57,even judged by there is no.,vedic_gathas
58,reason to give up the souls of rectitude and the world want to know what the real value of morality is in the scheme of the universe.,vedic_gathas
59,ga tha seeks to deepen this conviction in the final victory of virtue.,vedic_gathas
60,through the grace of mazda mazda does so ordain that out of evil comet good.,vedic_gathas
61,he who brings forth rose from the very midst of thorns is also able to turn the autumn into spring a aa lene a ceti thereupon ahura mazda surveying the world with insight or circumspection spoke there does not exist a single prince nor a prophet who lives for the sake of rectitude.,vedic_gathas
62,therefore indeed the creator has moulded you zarathustra for their progress and protection.,vedic_gathas
63,the busy world is apt to forget the most important lesson of life.,vedic_gathas
64,so merciful mazda sends prophets now and then to remind men of their highest destiny.,vedic_gathas
65,and athar yan zarathustra is the foremost of all the prophets he is the earliest of the aryan prophets being referred to ﻿the rigged as parse rama as the prophet who teaches the religion of ahura to the maghavats then ahura mazda in harmony with asia ii a the in a if rath the scripture for him the prophet salvation for the world.,vedic_gathas
66,and sacred laws for the saints but where a is that conscience which alone can impart all these things to the mortals a bring salvation to mankind.,vedic_gathas
67,but unless man has the goodwill to accept the gospel it does not benefit him at all ga tha is the best of the scriptures where is there any other book which points out the end of life so lucidly and is thus the primal gospel a if a do not read these what else would i read a mazda gives to the prophet the scripture.,vedic_gathas
68,the scripture containing the lessons of the prophet is his main instrument.,vedic_gathas
69,it lays down the rules and regulations which he spiraea zarathustra is here known tome as one who alone listens to my directions he desires me mazda and rectitude.,vedic_gathas
70,this is why for preaching rectitude i have conferred on him the status of the prophet.,vedic_gathas
71,bhagavan zarathustra is the first and the foremost of ali the prophets he raised the jars voice of protest against a the divorce of morality and religion in the then current vedic religion.,vedic_gathas
72,he alone who is commissioned by mazda can lead a nation one should surrender himself completely to maha rate zarathustra even as moses did.,vedic_gathas
73,when this ancient one calls you submit to him.,vedic_gathas
74,for even moses took orders from khz zarathustra thereupon the soul of the world lamented: in this disaster when i long fora master hero alas that to would get only the feeble voice of an impotent man.,vedic_gathas
75,of when would he come he who can give metre protection of his able arms a to is not wisdom to attach too much importance to physical strength.,vedic_gathas
76,one who cannot control himself how can he control others they know not that it is the way of mazda to conquer without the help of the sword.,vedic_gathas
77,he kills without the sword i a changes the heart.,vedic_gathas
78,oh ahura do ye give to them all men as strength rectitude and nonchalance and also give such conscience as holds chooses security and peace.,vedic_gathas
79,may i too of mazda recognize you to be the highest object of knowledge not physical prowess but rectitude and nonchalance are the real source of strength.,vedic_gathas
80,so the soul of the world a a a need not wail.,vedic_gathas
81,one who possesses these two is stronger than an emperor an emperor succumbs to temptation saint does not.,vedic_gathas
82,strength of character enables the virtuous to prevail over the vicious at the last reckoning.,vedic_gathas
83,this san important risk it clearly states that mazda yas na a does not encourage asceticism.,vedic_gathas
84,family life need not prick against the conscience of a mazda on the other hand family life is active ne a greater scope for activity.,vedic_gathas
85,when would rectitude conscience and non chance come tome?,vedic_gathas
86,do thou oh mazda vouchsafe equity tor this great magma church oh ahura for our protection come speedily with thy graces the basis of rectitude is equity.,vedic_gathas
87,equal treatment to all.,vedic_gathas
88,do unto others what you would do unto yourself equity is the foundation of a corporate life a united church magma in the mirror one finds himself reflected over again.,vedic_gathas
89,a mag ha vat parsi should feel himself present in the brother maghavat.,vedic_gathas
90,trial element of mazda all the deeds of holy rectitude ate the duties inculcated by conscience so that i at indeed satisfy serve the soul of the world now saluting and with out spread hands i would first of all entreat for bliss which is the many es sen but bliss is the characteristic element of mazda.,vedic_gathas
91,man sometimes gets a glimpse of bliss.,vedic_gathas
92,he wishes to have it always and ever and it is his privilege to be able to enjoy perpetual bliss.,vedic_gathas
93,athar van zarathustra starts his gospel with the prayer for bliss the objective and consummation of human life.,vedic_gathas
94,man becomes more and more blissful as he approaches nearer and nearer to mazda.,vedic_gathas
95,this is possible through righteous deeds and service of mankind when he is attuned to mazda bliss never departs from how can sugar ever be devoid of sweetness a the saints are not only always joyful themselves but their very presence makes others joyous oh mazda to me who approach you through conscience grant the gain of both the selves of the tangible i a the lower self as well as of that which is the spiritual i a the higher self so that the aspirant may through rectitude persist in holiness.,vedic_gathas
96,recognition of two planes of consciousness mind and soul the introspect consciousness and the introspection a consciousness is the basis of religious philosophy.,vedic_gathas
97,mind a introspect consciousness is always the play thing of the two opposite forces of pleasure and pain.,vedic_gathas
98,the soul is above the reach of these two oppositecurrents.,vedic_gathas
99,thus it is ever delightful always satisfied in its status as the witness of the mind.,vedic_gathas
100,the first lesson that saint teaches tote disciple is to ask him to rise beyond the life of the mind to the life of the soul.,vedic_gathas
101,when one is well established in the life of the soul he can be as indifferent to the pleasures and pains of his own mind as he is to the pleasures and pains of a third person.,vedic_gathas
102,this is ha urva tat so often repeated in the gatha.,vedic_gathas
103,thus a knowledge of the two consciousness two a hus is called the path of delight or saba ga path of sufism or theosophy.,vedic_gathas
104,there are two self in you my friend one lofty as the high heaven and the other low ashe deep sea.,vedic_gathas
105,a towards me a who weave compose hymns wonderfully unto you oh rectitude unto conscience and unto ahura mazda because of all whom i a by whose grace faith develops unfailing nonchalance towards me do please come to my bliss.,vedic_gathas
106,a to is futile to expect delight except from mazda in until one believes that mazda really exists and that he is our greatest friend.,vedic_gathas
107,one gets peace only when he has known god.,vedic_gathas
108,a a who have by means of conscience well restored the a soul to its own abode the function of introspection and am aware of the benefits of the deeds of ahura mazda a shall so long as i may and can exhort for the pursuit of rectitude.,vedic_gathas
109,the soul is the witness self.,vedic_gathas
110,its proper function is tobe a witness i a to review the activities of the mind for when the mind a becomes perturbed by passions the soul is clouded it goes a to the background.,vedic_gathas
111,if the mind is cleansed of passions and becomes serene the soul emerges and resumes its function.,vedic_gathas
112,this is here stated to be the restoration of the soul to its own abode.,vedic_gathas
113,its a state of perfect peace and may be attained with the help of conscience by subduing the passions a it is an accepted truth that the seer is different from the seen.,vedic_gathas
114,the soul is different from the mind.,vedic_gathas
115,through oh rectitude when will i fe to find you and!,vedic_gathas
116,to know conscience and also devotlah which is the way to ahura mazda the most beneficent and when with this evangel we shall be able by our tongue to reclaim greatly the perverts rectitude conscience and godliness are the features that distinguish mankind from the animal world human being from nature.,vedic_gathas
117,a stranger in this world his true citizenship is in the ethical and ideal sphere and so let him dwell on these features in order to realise the dignity of man even the hooligans are amenable to the appeal of virtue and if the demand of rectitude is often repeated to them it would ultimately change their heart the gentle pen is more powerful than the sword come along with conscience and give us rectitude holding long life.,vedic_gathas
118,by your noble maxims mazda enthuse strongly zarathustra and these others as well so that we may smash the opposition of the enemy.,vedic_gathas
119,conscience is the first factor of the moral life.,vedic_gathas
120,through conscience mazda sustains the aspirant.,vedic_gathas
121,a conscientious virtuous man can convert the enemy into friend a be a hew the figure of a friend out of stone.,vedic_gathas
122,oh rectitude give us that excellence which is the reward of conscience.,vedic_gathas
123,oh faith grant to vistas and to myself our wish.,vedic_gathas
124,oh mazda you too do give and flourish those mantras which we hear lead to attainment god rea li stion a what we lack is an earnest desire for the vision of mazda.,vedic_gathas
125,if the desire were very strong in us it would have found out the means of achievement.,vedic_gathas
126,where there is a will there is a way a our primary task is to make the desire strong when you are really thirsty you water mazda is sure to give this one myself being at his best purity would realise you the best deity with rectitude the best faculty.,vedic_gathas
127,i becoming would worship ahura for manly fra sho sh tra and for me as well as for those to whom you consign conscience for all time.,vedic_gathas
128,mazda lies latent in every body.,vedic_gathas
129,the highest end of of human life is to realise him to make him real patent.,vedic_gathas
130,a this is to be done by means of rectitude.,vedic_gathas
131,the holier man becomes the fitter he becomes for the manifestation of mazda through him to others as well as for the vision of mazda by him with these lauds oh ahura mazda we would adore you and adore rectitude too and the best i.e.,vedic_gathas
132,social conscience as we flock to the congregation to praises you are the most adorable send us the firmness of love.,vedic_gathas
133,the strength of one becomes the strength of the rest.,vedic_gathas
134,each one becomes a cup bearer to the rest.,vedic_gathas
135,whom so you teach the law of rectitude and conscience to them you speedily make their wishes successful.,vedic_gathas
136,thus sol know you to be un deficient and elegant famed in glory.,vedic_gathas
137,a religious man is afraid of the burden of endless desires but mazda fulfils the few noble desires that a pious man happens to entertain.,vedic_gathas
138,so that i may thereby uphold rectitude and conscience for all time oh you mazda do teach me with your own words from the region of the many from phenomena a would come up to you noumenon asia a had been prior to the creation of life.,vedic_gathas
139,man attains primal peace when the illusion of the world ceases and he fixes his eye on the noumenon in the midst of phenomena this risk speaks of a stage which is prior to the play of the many i a prior to creation.,vedic_gathas
140,this status is known i as the brahma aspect of god which is transcendent and a impersonal god while the status after creation is known a as the sara aspect i a immanent and personal god.,vedic_gathas
141,we may speak of the former as the god of philosophy i a for conception alone and of the latter as the god of religion i a for worship as well.,vedic_gathas
142,they are not two entities two gods there is only one entity looked at from two different points of view a are creation and post creation.,vedic_gathas
143,belief in this entity brahma or sara is called in the ga tha am er eta tat for it teaches man the value of his a own life and points out to him his highest possibilities a according to all saints apostles and prophets this: faith a means permanent immortal peace.,vedic_gathas
144,the human soul is a immortal and so permanent peace is not an impossible ideal a the many are the many forces of a mazda.,vedic_gathas
145,they did not come into existence all ona sudden and out of a mere nothing.,vedic_gathas
146,they issued out of the transcendent status of mazda and therefore they belong to mazda.,vedic_gathas
147,that this transcendent status is also an aspect of mazda is made clear by the words cay toasts a i would go up to you freed from the clutch of the many the atheist may feel inclined to argue that the two \natural forces positive and negative spent a and a angry suffice to explain the process of creation aes to does then the theme of mazda come in at all.,vedic_gathas
148,argue in the words of jamal a there is no scope for mazda to enter it to the arena.,vedic_gathas
149,a he forgets that if there were not ahura mazda at the back ground holding together the two forces their opposite a be action would neutralise each other and the result would be a me zero.,vedic_gathas
150,there would not have been the universe and an atheist therein to question the existence of mazda ge a mazda is one and his energy force is one.,vedic_gathas
151,only it acts in two different ways it is called centripetal or centrifugal according as its field of activity is different.,vedic_gathas
152,or when it goes away from the centre it is called centrifugal and when it returns to the centre it is called centripetal.,vedic_gathas
153,the force that takes us away from mazda is angry the force that takes us back to mazda is spent a a the force is incessantly coming out of mazda and going back to him.,vedic_gathas
154,there are thus cross currents in even plane of existence and therefore the play of spent a and angry many in every walk of life.,vedic_gathas
155,when there is the loyalty of abraham in one pan of the scale there springs up the refractoriness of pharaoh in the other pan to counter balance it such is the way of the world.,vedic_gathas
156,but when one transcends a the worldly force and enters into the presence of mazda by overcoming desires with the help of kshathram a peace is re established as had been the original state of the soul when you attain unto colour lessness serenity that you originally possessed you will have no enemies pharaoh will make peace with moses a now i shall proclaim to those who have assembled here all that is to be learnt from mazda viz the hymns of the a lord the imperatives of conscience and what noble principled rectitude is which by its light reveals beatitude.,vedic_gathas
157,hear the best with your ears and discern by pure mind a choose the ought man by man every man for his own a self before the great trial comes wake up to this my counsel prophets can only instruct it is for us to follow.,vedic_gathas
158,it is better to think over the problem of life in cooler moments and thus equip oneself for facing the challenge of circumstances now there are those two primordial many guns a forces which are said to be co relative and co ordinate in thought word and deed one is the better one and the other is the bad.,vedic_gathas
159,of these two the wise choose the right one but not the fools the many have no independent existence.,vedic_gathas
160,they owe a their existence to mazda.,vedic_gathas
161,them as my many thus these who hold angry many to be the rival of mazda and on that account impute duality of god head to mazda yas na are entirely mistaken.,vedic_gathas
162,on account of their predilection for two guns and not two gods as the simpletons state the iranians were known as dualist for a eyen at the time of the rivera we find in the rivera when these two many guns came into contact they a created motion as well as inertia which ultimately in life a a i ae came to be the worst mind malignance in the vicious and the best mind conscience in the virtuous.,vedic_gathas
163,out of these two many guns the dishonest man chooses the worst acts whilst the holiest man chooses the righteous many who thus wears the hardest stone shield.,vedic_gathas
164,those who satisfy ahura by truthful deeds realise mazda.,vedic_gathas
165,the sage chooses the path of the right as against that of the pleasant and thus takes his stand on solid ground on eternal verity.,vedic_gathas
166,these two paths are quite distinct and katha upanishad simply reproduces the idea of this risk when it says i of them two the deva worshippers do not see aright as they proceed to worship by way of deification attribution of divinity to insignificant things because they choose the narrowest mentality they glide to infatuation foolish passions which is calculated to deflect the life of the mortals a bhagavan zarathustra here lays down the fundamental principle of his religion explaining as to why he differs from deva yas na the dey basis pay more attention to non essential matters making a fetish of every minor tite they idolize the medium and pay to rituals the devotion that is due to god.,vedic_gathas
167,those who pay more attention to little things miss the great things of life.,vedic_gathas
168,here we are asked not to suppose a thing to be what it is not not to place such value on a thing as it has not got not to consider any ceremonial as indispensable for the for ship of mazda ie not to make an idol of any ceremonial mazda alone and nothing else is our concern how long will you go on dallying with the shape of the jug?,vedic_gathas
169,leave the jug alone seek water.,vedic_gathas
170,it snot that deva yas na has got no value at all.,vedic_gathas
171,but the good is the enemy of the better and if we choose the good in preference to the better we can never reach our highest goal.,vedic_gathas
172,this is at least stagnation if not the beginning of the down ward march.,vedic_gathas
173,so jamal advises us not to be satisfied with the good but to adopt the better procedure.,vedic_gathas
174,to the other one he who does not take to deva yas na comes nonchalance conscience and rectitude and unflinching faith brings about corporation and solidarity.,vedic_gathas
175,such happens to them as is ie.,vedic_gathas
176,befits the metal with which he mazda had built them in the beginning.,vedic_gathas
177,the wise man pays attention to essential things non chance conscience rectitude faith and unity.,vedic_gathas
178,he thereby gets rid of affectation and reverts to simplicity which is the natural instinct of man.,vedic_gathas
179,rectitude is inborn to man it is in his build.,vedic_gathas
180,a and when frenzy goes out of the these sinners then a mazda with the help of conscience inspires in them non a chance ahura himself instructs them who give the evil up unto the hands of rectitude.,vedic_gathas
181,the sinner however is not lost for eyer.,vedic_gathas
182,as soon as he gets rid of his passion he develops conscience and nonchalance and thus opens himself up to the influence of mazda and is saved.,vedic_gathas
183,of ahura mazda may we be they who going to reno a date their life choose fraternity and rectitude.,vedic_gathas
184,for the mind turns towards the glimpse of the goal.,vedic_gathas
185,rectitude and fraternity are the outward signs of a renovated life.,vedic_gathas
186,renovation is called @ar in tantra literature when man is bor twice he plants his foot upon the head of all causes i a laws of nature a then forthwith happens the collapse of the inflation of the accursed devil and the purest ones are fastened to the cord of conscience they who strive for the good prizes of mazda and rectitude in his heart of hearts man detests falsehood and loves truth.,vedic_gathas
187,thus evil cannot hold him in bondage for ever.,vedic_gathas
188,this relieving feature is the seed of the collapse of the devil.,vedic_gathas
189,such collapse is bound to ensue since moral order or asa is the truth of the very structure of the universe.,vedic_gathas
190,even malice is rooted in love.,vedic_gathas
191,these two selves the lower and the higher self a that mazda assigned ye mortals stimulate right and a wrong respectively which awards misery to the dishonest and happiness to the honest yet by all these welfare evil is not wholly evil.,vedic_gathas
192,in tackling it the soul acquires moral strength ie.,vedic_gathas
193,competence for nearness to god this is the relieving feature of sin.,vedic_gathas
194,recollect with your mind a shall proclaim a message a a that has not been heard before.,vedic_gathas
195,it is the best for those a who on account of fiendish mentality devastate the regions of rectitude as well as the best for those who are devoted to mazda.,vedic_gathas
196,in order that thereby we may know firmly the way of the soul we flock you ahura as to a preceptor to learn.,vedic_gathas
197,mazda tell us how we may live in rectitude.,vedic_gathas
198,mazda is the only preceptor for all our worldly preceptors get their inspiration from him.,vedic_gathas
199,if he did not out of kindness disclose himself to man none could have reasoned up to him the mentality and the light that you confer on thy notaries the bliss that you inspire in them the task that when man and woman lose their difference by rising above all sexual impulse there thou art when one has cast off his selfish desires and adopted universal life there thou art.,vedic_gathas
200,when one sees every body in his own self and sees his own self in every body that is universal life.,vedic_gathas
201,in order that rectitude may be my resource of ye ahura mazda i wish for holy faith through best conscience i wish for me also firm nonchalance with whose help i would expunge the evil.,vedic_gathas
202,sages hold faith to be the mark of spiritual life.,vedic_gathas
203,tell me your disciple as to how rectitude can avail me the better.,vedic_gathas

411,=a it is our duty to follow the right because it is right in scorn of the consequence at the same time equanimity is too precious wealth to be bartered away for any other gain.,vedic_gathas
412,to whomsoever god has announced victory and triumph to him success and unsuccess are one.,vedic_gathas
413,a in the degree a man comes nearer to mazda he obtains command over the duality of pleasure and pain loss and gain weal and woe.,vedic_gathas
414,a aw he has no thought of pleasure or pain loss or gain victory or defeat.,vedic_gathas
415,am blind to aught other than god.,vedic_gathas
416,i see him alone.,vedic_gathas
417,such is the demand of love.,vedic_gathas
418,proclaim it by thinking of you and you alone i have become you a there is no i left in me.,vedic_gathas
419,glory be to thy name wherever i they in whom there is exceeding doubt tremble at loo up i see only you.,vedic_gathas
420,this is assimilation with god our satespmse when we of maids useful a your ea rede a i rectitude from them conscience shrinks away.,vedic_gathas
421,if one persistently refuses to act upto'the dictates of conscience it dies out reducing the man to the level of a brute a doubt acts like a prison.,vedic_gathas
422,it does not allow the man to proceed to any direction.,vedic_gathas
423,a those who have faith in mazda can face any difficulty.,vedic_gathas
424,the swan is not afraid of the sea the cock is.,vedic_gathas
425,if the tongue ceases to make the distinction between the sour and the sweet when the dog conscience makes friends with the thief evil impulse who will guard the man a those who are well acquainted with thy noble faith of mazda and yet disserve by misconduct as if ignorant of conscience from them rectitude recedes as wild beasts do from us of conscience.,vedic_gathas
426,i consider noble faith to be the benign root of rectitude.,vedic_gathas
427,all these of mazda are contingent on thy nonchalance.,vedic_gathas
428,how is it that those who prescribe the rules of purity do not themselves practise them a sages have told acceptance of activity to be the course to do is better than not too none so worse as the inactive faith is optimistic.,vedic_gathas
429,it encourages enterprise and disparages timidity.,vedic_gathas
430,now spirituality and immortality godliness both flow from you.,vedic_gathas
431,by the strength of conscience rectitude also flows along with faith as well as solidarity and strength.,vedic_gathas
432,with all these of mazda you are available to the wise.,vedic_gathas
433,what are your laws of mazda and what i is your design a which is your rates and which your worship a tell us mazda let us hear so that it may grant us the good fortune of your guidance.,vedic_gathas
434,teach us the path of rectitude which is the selfhood characteristic expression of conscience.,vedic_gathas
435,the prophet wants to: know how the aspirant should behave.,vedic_gathas
436,about that path of ahura which you told me to be of conscience and which happens to be the religion of all the prophets and which by good deeds promotes rectitude as well and which brings to the righteous recompense of which you are the giver.,vedic_gathas
437,the way of all the saints saoshyants may be said to be one only.,vedic_gathas
438,for in essential matters there is no difference between one prophet and another.,vedic_gathas
439,to my embodied better mind soul of mazda grant such boon as leads to the improvement of the living world through deeds of conscience.,vedic_gathas
440,for the duties of rectitude give me of ahura your directions i shall carry them out.,vedic_gathas
441,inasmuch as the same god is worshipped everywhere all of them are different phases of the same religion.,vedic_gathas
442,now of mazda teach me the best words and the best deeds and then beaded do you send me conscience and rectitude.,vedic_gathas
443,i wish for your nonchalance.,vedic_gathas
444,me the true life of good will grant unto desire for pleasure should: be discarded but not desire for the good.,vedic_gathas
445,without the desire for self realisation or god realisation life becomes blank mere darkness.,vedic_gathas
446,resolution.,vedic_gathas
447,isth only way by which a mans ideal can become actual those who smother every resolution live in an atmosphere of dense darkness this is tantamount to killing the self.,vedic_gathas
448,everything that thou hast of wealth and handicraft was it not at first a quest and a thought a whether speedily or slowly he who is seeker will he a finder.,vedic_gathas
449,development of personality is said to be the highest good this is to be attained through the satisfaction of all rational desires that alone is good for ones own self which is good for anybody whosoever ie.,vedic_gathas
450,good for all.,vedic_gathas
451,may sole ruler ahura mazda give solidarity and strength which i ask from him.,vedic_gathas
452,for upholding rectitude teach me of faith the tule which is the grace of fortune and the course of conscience.,vedic_gathas
453,maha rate zarathustra lays down here the fundamental rule of ethics viz do to others as you would that they a should do to you.,vedic_gathas
454,i find my image reflected in your eye i find myself in you audit shouts am you and you are i for both of us.,vedic_gathas
455,have grown from the same:common seed.,vedic_gathas
456,now bestow on me the holiness of holiness highest holiness which is the greatest of all assets a do thou of mazda kindle in us the holiest many best propensity so that it may for the sake of rectitude furnish the power of conscience towards a long life of bliss for all time to come of may that man attain better than the good who teaches us rhe straight path of saba love the path of the tangible gross and the spiritual subtle self.,vedic_gathas
457,a true discipline it is.,vedic_gathas
458,wherein ahura lies and whereby of mazda the devout gentleman becomes attuned to you.,vedic_gathas
459,therefore a thought you to be the holy seed of mazda since thine are those arms with which you give protection and by which you award benediction both tote sinner and a to the virtuous.,vedic_gathas
460,your glowing fire is vividiwith rectitude.,vedic_gathas
461,it serves to lend strength my conscience.,vedic_gathas
462,i recognised you to be holy ahura mazda as soon as i found you to be the foremost at the creation of life and as you award requiteful deeds as well as what are requiteful a words viz ill to the ill and good excellence to the good a by thy laws at the next turn of life.,vedic_gathas
463,there could be no end of life if the world were a mere play of chances without any order or law.,vedic_gathas
464,end of life is possible to be achieved by appropriate means only if the universe is governed by law.,vedic_gathas
465,it is not however possible to live even for a day without the supreme conviction that there san end of fife irrespective of whether that end is pleasure or duty.,vedic_gathas
466,thus the great postulate of life itself is that there isth rule of law in the universe that it is a cosmos and not a chaos.,vedic_gathas
467,the law of mazda makes it a cosmos makes it possible for us to live and achieve our end.,vedic_gathas
468,if life hasa positive value then the upholder of the law of cause and effect is definitely spenta.,vedic_gathas
469,if natural law laws of nature is so necessary for ordinary animal existence how much greater is the need for moral laws for the aspirant who wants to proceed towards god realisation without the lead of such laws he would be bewildered and unable to take even a single step towards his goal of there were no cause and effect which path would the aspirant take a mazda governs the universe by his laws or and the logical consequence of the great law of cause and effect is that if you sow a thorn you will reap a thorn.,vedic_gathas
470,of mazda at the moment your spent a many state guna comes to any body at that very moment nonchalance and conscience also come.,vedic_gathas
471,to him by whose deeds the region of rectitude expands the preceptor enjoins faith and him no one can deflect from your duty.,vedic_gathas
472,there is no doubt evil the world but there is also spent a many which can conquer it with the help of conscience and nonchalance.,vedic_gathas
473,as soon as a man resorts to spent a many he puts himself on the right track to prosperity both material and a realised you to be noble of mazda when conscience a re ay a a a a ask you at what time you would understand the purpose of your body and mind a such bliss can be achieved because though spent a and and angry are two opposite forces they do not have equal value spent a is positive and angry is negative and at the last reckoning the positive prevails over the negative thus love overcomes hatred and truth defeats falsehood.,vedic_gathas
474,"""truth and falsehood may not be said to be equal in value for while truth is one falsehoods are many.",vedic_gathas
475,then again falsehood is dependent on truth.,vedic_gathas
476,it can serve its purpose only in proportion to its ability to imitate the truth falsehood presupposes the existence of truth false coin presupposes the existence of genuine coin but truth is not dependent on falsehood.,vedic_gathas
477,it shines in its is own glory: darkness has only a negative existence.,vedic_gathas
478,it is not a positive substance.,vedic_gathas
479,its merely want of light.,vedic_gathas
480,as soon as we approach neater to the sun darkness vanishes so soon as we come to the presence of mazda all evil vanish es this emphasis on the positiveness of mazda a responsible for the clumsy confusion that angry many isth rival a not of spent a many but of ahura mazda.,vedic_gathas
481,then i told him the first i am zarathustra who would be areal opponent of him who wilfully sins and a resolute gratifier supporter of the pious.,vedic_gathas
482,this is why dose prestige and think of strength whenever mazda to praise and pray to you.,vedic_gathas
483,resistance to evil is as much important to moral life as promotion of virtue it is such militancy that earned for prophet avatar parish rama the epithet that he was a brahmana of kshatriya type.,vedic_gathas
484,it is rot unlikely that the purana describe then i recognised you to be holy of mazda when conscience came tome.,vedic_gathas
485,i asked her whom would you teach me?,vedic_gathas
486,thus i would render salutation to your fire so long as i wish and long for rectitude.,vedic_gathas
487,conscience leads to to god.,vedic_gathas
488,if conscience does not generate the belief in mazda as the source of conscience it does not do all that it should.,vedic_gathas
489,duty without faith in god is insufficient then give me rectitude which i invoke.,vedic_gathas
490,through faith i would attain perfection.,vedic_gathas
491,test us by what are your tests in this respect a whatever your tests are they are for finding out the strong.,vedic_gathas
492,for powerful as you are you grant the wishes only of the strong.,vedic_gathas
493,an aspirant has to acquire the strength to pass through all trials a walking cannot reach the goal then i i a strong man is never afraid of tests en i recognized you to be noble mazda when conscience appeared to me and i was illumined by your words inflict any trouble on me i am the heart giver dedicated amongst men.,vedic_gathas
494,i would accomplish whatever you tell me to be the best.,vedic_gathas
495,the greater the difficulty the greater is the gain when one overcomes it.,vedic_gathas
496,a staunch devotee welcomes troubles as it makes his spirit stronger when you told me pursue rectitude through equity you told me something unheard of before.,vedic_gathas
497,i would stand up notwithstanding whatever may happen to me.,vedic_gathas
498,devoted and upright i would proceed with great vigour so that your blessings may put the votary in joy.,vedic_gathas
499,er a i realised you to be holy ahura mazda when conscience came tome.,vedic_gathas
500,for the attainment of wealth and joy give me that long life which none but you hold and also lasting prizes which you destined in your nonchalance.,vedic_gathas
501,one who sees others in himself and himself in others does not stray from rectitude.,vedic_gathas
502,those who strive for spiritual uplift are not on that account denied the benefit of material prosperity just as an affectionate man gives a present to a friend similarly mazda send me your equity.,vedic_gathas
503,what your nonchalance is that arises from rectitude.,vedic_gathas
504,i would stand up for strengthening the creed along with those who recite whoever sows fot the sake of wheat gets the hay also your mantras in addition.,vedic_gathas
505,the most important of all the points is the truth that mazda is the friend of man ready with his presents with the eagerness of a friend for a friend.,vedic_gathas
506,but is there any ground for thinking that the almighty lord cherishes any love towards this tiny creature the piggy man a no doubt mazda is not apprehensible by the normal eye but that doesn't mean that he snot visible at all.,vedic_gathas
507,the blind mans eye is susceptible to heat only and not to light.,vedic_gathas
508,that does not mean that there is no such thing as light.,vedic_gathas
509,mazda is present every where and when the heart has been cleansed of every other desire mazda is reflected there on as an image on a polished mirror.,vedic_gathas
510,of one does not believe that mazda can be realised that he can be'seen and heard what good does he expect to derive from the scripture?,vedic_gathas
511,for the scripture only professes to téach the way of god realisation character building can give only a partial satisfaction to the self but mazda is the real reality the origin and the end of the universe.,vedic_gathas
512,with which human soul is intimately associated and without the experience of mazda there cannot be complete satisfaction i.e.,vedic_gathas
513,satisfaction of the whole self.,vedic_gathas
514,i realised you to be noble.,vedic_gathas
515,mazda ahura when density science came to me and presented blessed contentment the ly a a8 best mentality.,vedic_gathas
516,a virile man should not be panderous to the vicious.,vedic_gathas
517,may thy virtuous followers smash all devil dom.,vedic_gathas
518,now of ahura zarathustra chooses that many which is the best of thine all.,vedic_gathas
519,may rectitude incarnate materialise and the up mind be vivacious.,vedic_gathas
520,may faith steve for procuring nonchalance which reveal the self.,vedic_gathas
521,may conscience through deeds award plenitude self realisation means the attempt to realise the self ie.,vedic_gathas
522,to make real actual the possibilities that lie latent in the soul.,vedic_gathas
523,in a sense this may be looked upon as an attempt to establish the kingdom of heaven on earth.,vedic_gathas
524,worship i would worship one like you.,vedic_gathas
525,of mazda teach one like me who is your friend.,vedic_gathas
526,may dear rectitude bestow perfection so that conscience may appear to me.,vedic_gathas
527,this i ask you tell me aright ahura how proceeding to this i ask you tell me aright ahura a what is the acme of best life.,vedic_gathas
528,how can i achieve this of mazda that such state of things may invert a state where in holy rectitude is distasteful to all while the malign many tao guna is cordial and dear.,vedic_gathas
529,this i ask you tell me aright ahura a which person is the first creator and up holder of rectitude which one is he who chalked out the path of the sun and the stars a who is it that makes the moon wax and wane?,vedic_gathas
530,i wish to know all this and more as well.,vedic_gathas
531,this i ask you tell me aright ahura which person upholds the earth and also the heaven from falling down?,vedic_gathas
532,who upholds water and plants who yokes quickness to the storm and lightning?,vedic_gathas
533,which person is ie inspirer of conscience a the storm.,vedic_gathas
534,a a a this i ask you tell me aright ahura a which artist made light and darkness and which artist made sleep and waking a who is he that made the dawn the noon and the dusk which recall the sagacious to their business prayer a both light and darkness are creations of mazda.,vedic_gathas
535,in other words he is manifest everywhere only there is difference in the degree of his manifestation.,vedic_gathas
536,it is higher in the beast than in the tree higher in man than in the beast and highest in the apostles one may ask if ahura mazda created the night natural and moral darkness as well how can he be called good.,vedic_gathas
537,it is to warn these sceptics that maha rate had in the a the previous suite repeated again and again that mazda is spenta.,vedic_gathas
538,mazda is all good.,vedic_gathas
539,he all light.,vedic_gathas
540,but when the force runs away from the centre the rays would be darker and darker the further they travel away from the source.,vedic_gathas
541,but the a force cannot be going away from him for ever.,vedic_gathas
542,all move an gra many appears to be intolerable only when one loses sight of the whole circle described by the force and confines his attention only to one half of it viz the descending arc.,vedic_gathas
543,evil is only apparently evil it is ultimately for our good.,vedic_gathas
544,it helps unto build our character and character is necessary for god realisation which is\ our ultimate and permanent good.,vedic_gathas
545,viewed in this light evil loses its poi arc and starts back towards mazda.,vedic_gathas
546,angry many has then a a neon changed to spent a many it is no longer a descending a but is an ascending arc ie.,vedic_gathas
547,the force then goes back to mazda takes one back to mazda a the force is bound to return to mazda the force started from light and comes back to light again.,vedic_gathas
548,it is a therefore a force of light spenta.,vedic_gathas
549,the dark period caused by its outward course is only a temporary phase.,vedic_gathas
550,that does not affect the nature of the light at the source that does not affect the character of mazda as all good.,vedic_gathas
551,a the duality of angry many the polarity of the two forces is a necessary are condition of the creation of the universe there can be no creation without there being variety.,vedic_gathas
552,so long as the force of mazda is confined in him does not issue out of him there is no creation men in the universe is ultimately: circular parallel lines meet at infinity.,vedic_gathas
553,thus at infinity the force describes an ea this i ask you tell me aright ahura a whether what ritual prayer is sure to yield fruit and make the mind serene and fit for the vision.,vedic_gathas
554,of mazda unless the aspirant in over anxiety for immediate result brings in disbelief and i say is correct viz faith embellishes rectitude by deeds and to them you send nonchalance through conscience for whom you made the world full of struggle for existence.,vedic_gathas
555,irreverence patience is necessary to hatch the chic out of the egg.,vedic_gathas
556,to one who does not see a part separately but sees it as a part of the whole the thorn appears to be beautiful like the rose.,vedic_gathas
557,both in his fondness and his displeasure he is equally charming to me.,vedic_gathas
558,in proportion as a man becomes established in kshathram and gives up all petty desires the world appears to him to be beautiful the arena of the sport ﻿the lord.,vedic_gathas
559,that i ask you tell me aright ahura who has fashioned noble faith together with nonchalance a who in his wisdom makes the son alike to the father?,vedic_gathas
560,mazda i approach you on questions about these you who are the protector of the universe through spent a many latina guna.,vedic_gathas
561,mazda makes the son alike to the rather in other words there is reign of law in the universe.,vedic_gathas
562,the universe is a cosmos and not a chaos.,vedic_gathas
563,but this does not assail the fact that man is free.,vedic_gathas
564,by mastering the laws of nature in the outer world he can rule over nature aid by resorting to nonchalance in the inner world he can always keep himself free man was made in the image of god the son in the likeness of the father.,vedic_gathas
565,they lose sight of the fact that if we reject all our ideas of god as being anthropomorphic we will be left without any ideas at all.,vedic_gathas
566,there will bean unbridgeable gulf between god and man.,vedic_gathas
567,this i ask you tell me aright samurai would meditate on all that are your commandments so that i may through conscience understand the precepts and also that through rectitude i might attain the perfection of life and thereby my soul may arrive at self balance.,vedic_gathas
568,this ask you tell me aright ahura how can a achieve the benefic religion which savants teach for regrowth of nonchalance through this superb nonchalance mazda the saint becomes similar to you dwelling in the same abode with rectitude and conscience.,vedic_gathas
569,like the flame of the candle in the presence of the sun he may be said to be both existent and non existent.,vedic_gathas
570,this to ask you tell me aright ahura: tell me about that religion which is the best of all and with would bestow on me simultaneously both rectitude and prosperity and which through the words of faith would stick to right deeds for my edification of mazda i wish to know your will.,vedic_gathas
571,the best religion is that which teaches pursuit of rectitude within the world and not by renouncing the world.,vedic_gathas
572,this i ask you tell me aright ahura: how faith would reach them to whom your religion appeals i know you to be the foremost of all all others i denounce with my heart.,vedic_gathas
573,"this i ask you tell me aright ""ahura a who is virtuous what i ask who is vicious?",vedic_gathas
574,or which one isth villain a or is he the villain the vicious one who deflects me from your love?,vedic_gathas
575,how is he if he does not consider himself to be in the wrong when his narrow conscience misguided him a in secular law only the external act counts in moral law motive isth only factor for determining whether the action is right or wrong.,vedic_gathas
576,if the motive is good the action is right.,vedic_gathas
577,if goodness of of motive is wanting the action may not be counted as right.,vedic_gathas
578,bhagavan zarathustra here raises one of the mental problems of ethics whether the conscience err!,vedic_gathas
579,if a man abets the burning of a sati or throws a child in the ganga in the belief that he is doing the right thing can he be held guilty?,vedic_gathas
580,the verdict of ethics is that if man is true to his own conscience he is not guilty morally speaking but his individual conscience is to be improved by comparison with social conscience and he should always try to improve his conscience.,vedic_gathas
581,relative conscience is a good guide so far as it goes but the aim always should be to reach absolute conscience i.e the conscience of the perfect man.,vedic_gathas
582,a wrong balance is to be corrected with the help of a right balance relative conscience is to be corrected in the light of absolute conscience this i ask you tell me aright ahura a how would i abolish the evil to the finis away from us.,vedic_gathas
583,save them who are full of heresies neither do they delight in following the path of rectitude nor do they enjoy the conscience by communion with it.,vedic_gathas
584,nothing else than the love of mazda is: competent to eradicate evil impulses completely and redeem the sinner it is very necessary to make the heart immaculate.,vedic_gathas
585,for what we lack is only the power pharaoh but not his temperament this i ask.,vedic_gathas
586,you tell me aright ahura: how would i deliver the devil unto the hands of rectitude.,vedic_gathas
587,to would extirpate the evil with the strength of your gospel.,vedic_gathas
588,give me strong nerve against the villains thus i would destroy his snare and assault.,vedic_gathas
589,the words of the lords gospel sen hah ya mantra infuse new hope and new strength and enable.one to put up a stubborn.,vedic_gathas
590,fight.,vedic_gathas
591,kill the lower self with the strength of the higher self this i ask you tell me aright ahura if by rectitude you prevail over all herein in the universe when the two brawling fighters meet together with all those rites mazda which you confirm whither do you go?,vedic_gathas
592,to whom do you grant victory a it is preposterous to think that mazda help would go to the vicious and not: to the virtuous for mazda is the upholder of the moral order of the universe.,vedic_gathas
593,would mazda prefer the thorn to the rose a even among men we know how stern to the impure is the silent rebuke of purity how humiliating to the worldly and the selfish soul is the contact with unselfishness and generosity and we can understand the meaning of the triumph of the a of ce this i ask you tell me aright ahura: who is the slayer of rita tell me about all that there are.,vedic_gathas
594,send forme a splendid wise and self knowing preceptor.,vedic_gathas
595,may devotion through conscience come to him to him mazda to whomsoever you wish.,vedic_gathas
596,love of mazda is also the gift of mazda.,vedic_gathas
597,it is only the fortunate few that are attracted to him.,vedic_gathas
598,most of us are indifferent to him the existence of mazda does not make any difference in the course of our life.,vedic_gathas
599,to feel an irrepressible desire to see mazda is a rare fortune a gift from mazda bhagavan zarathustra very gracefully sets down the reason for promulgating mazda yas na which is radical ion of evil.,vedic_gathas
600,he by implication asks the question whether indra also is rita killer eradicator of vice as is claimed by the other branch of areas if indra were really rita killer there would have been no need for the reformation.,vedic_gathas
601,but he is not.,vedic_gathas
602,for in that case impious people could never have the impudence to claim to be favourites of god this i ask you tell me aright ahura: how will i whirl about along with you mazda?,vedic_gathas
603,grant your ecstasy so that it may be mine a would have command over spirituality and immortality through that mantra which we practise recite with rectitude.,vedic_gathas
604,the devotee lives in god he has become one with god.,vedic_gathas
605,there is no question of partnership duality the devotee has become one with god their duality is mere verbal apparent unity is the fact you wished to play the nard with yourself this is why you brought man into existence and made one into two a love of the free man who has the freedom to love or not and not the compulsory obedience of a slave gives zest to the play.,vedic_gathas
606,the wilful surrender of the free man is what the lord enjoys this i ask you tell me aright mazda: how can i properly ask for such reward as ten mares with horses and a camel.,vedic_gathas
607,for spirituality and immortality godliness can come to me only when i give up the desire for them.,vedic_gathas
608,this i ask you tell me aright ahura: he who does not give such meed to the deserving and the man who'gives it to truthful ourselves what the consequence for it befalls the former and i would also know what happens to the latter.,vedic_gathas
609,bhagavan zarathustra draws attention to the fact that these two widely divergent actions such as charity and stinginess cannot lead to the same consequence.,vedic_gathas
610,not prohibit acquisition of wealth but only wishes that charity should be the main object of the acquisition.,vedic_gathas
611,of mazda how can the wicked be said to be the possessors of moral courage.,vedic_gathas
612,this i ask you what to speak of them who tyrannies a that by which the kappas and the sikhs throw the world ina rage and by which the kava grow in obduracy such actions rectitude does not esteems beneficence if the rose water weré not putrid it would not have attracted beetles the religion that does not purify character hardly deserves to be called religion.,vedic_gathas
613,the oil that extinguishes the lamp is not oil it is water i would now speak out.,vedic_gathas
614,lend your ears and hear all those who have come from near and those who have come from far.,vedic_gathas
615,provider over this the most momentous thing.,vedic_gathas
616,let not the false prophet kill your soul second time.,vedic_gathas
617,in this manner by listening to my advice screen off the tongue of the evil one.,vedic_gathas
618,man cannot do away with all the theories about god and life survival after death he may reject the rest of them but there sone theory which he does not and cannot reject.,vedic_gathas
619,for without having some idea on these points whether his view is right or wrong one cannot proceed a single step in life.,vedic_gathas
620,its not a question whether he should have any philosophy at all it is only a question whether his philosophy is right or wrong.,vedic_gathas
621,a would now speak ﻿the two primordial many a guns forces of life of whom the nobler one told him that is dark a neither our minds nor our doctrines neither duties nor manners neither words nor deeds neither thoughts nor souls do agree.,vedic_gathas
622,a the lord wields these two forces destructive: and cons tractive both in gross and subtle forms one gets bound a through hedonism and released when he knows the lord.,vedic_gathas
623,zzz a a a day and night outwardly are contraries and enemies i but both of them work for the same purpose each calling the other like kinsfolk for bringing to completion their task.,vedic_gathas
624,maharaja zarathustra states that the universe is the a result of the action and interaction of two contrary forces a this is why there is so much conflict in the world.,vedic_gathas

Nobody other than You do I acknowledge. Therefore, protect mankind through truth. ",selected_yasna

",selected_yasna
379," But, whoever, being able to do so, does not do so, shall himself be ensnared by evil. Because he who is good to those who are evil is himself evil. And he who befriends the righteous is himself righteous. This is Your law ever since You first created us. ",selected_yasna
