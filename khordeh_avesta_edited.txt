about this we find in Vispered Kardah 13, first paragraph, thus: “Ashem
vispem manthrem yazamaide: Zarathushtrem hadhamanthrem yazamaide”,
i.e. we worship the entire manthra as holy; we worship Zarathushtra who is
one with manthras or the composer of the manthras. In several later books it
is stated that some writings of the Prophet Zarathushtra were so mysterious
that even the great sages could not comprehend their meaning. Moreover,
many famous Persian writers call him, “Paegambare Ramz-gu” (i.e. Prophet
who reveals the secrets). We have no certain evidence at present as to how
many these manthras were originally given by him.

and”? to prevent malice®.

wi Dr. Geldner takes this whole paragraph in the verse form of 8 lines.

wj Original meaning “unto one who asks for, unto one who does not ask for”.
wk The reduplicated form of the root khshnu (=to please) became “kukhshnu”.
wl i.e. as I who am Ahura Mazda, like Myself too.

wm Similar statement occurs for Meher yazata, too, with slight difference (see Meher yasht,
para 1).

wn i.e. Famine-producing; original meaning “pertaining to bad year’. After the Avesta, during
the period of Cuneiform Inscriptions, the Emperor Darius wishing prosperity for his own king-
dom from the Creator Ahura Mazda prays May the Lord protect my kingdom from the hostile
army and from the famine (hacha dushiyar)!” That inscription is as follows: Uta imam dahyaum
Aura Mazda patuva hacha hainaya, hacha dushiyar, hacha drauga ...... (see the writing
numbered H of Persepolis). Meaning:- (The Emperor Darius prays:) Also may Ahura Mazda
protect this kingdom (of mine) from the hostile army, from famine and from falsehood- deceit.

wo Original meaning “evil speaking”, from it “speaking quite contrary”.

wp Original meaning in order to withstand the malice, (root paiti-vaz).

(5) During the autumn season the leaves of trees wither; hence without
leaves the tree as it were becomes feeble and distressed.

(6) For the sake of leaves the tree raises both its hands with humility, the
Almighty Lord creates the Spring Season full of verdure from that.

(7) That Lord bestows upon that tree new leaves and freshness anew and
bestows new dress like the King Kaikhosrou.

(8) | Therefore, O man! why dost thou sit indifferently as the gate of
blessings is open from all sides, (i.e. if thou wilt perform homage
with sincere heart, thy wishes will be fulfilled).

(9) | O God! do not drive away from Thee this Thy sinful person by way
of love and grace.

(10) When Thou (O Lord of the Universe!) wilt drive me away from Thee,
who will call me? Moreover, when Thou wilt call me before Thee,
who will drive me away?


--- Page 355 ---

(11) Except Thee (O Lord of gifts) I do not from any man keep the hope;
only have hopes of obtaining gifts from Thee alone.

(12) From Thee there is the gift of entire goodness on me; but from me
there is (nothing) to (offer to) Thee except sin and transgression.

(13) O Almighty Lord! I do not say that Thou dost grant me gold and
silver (i.e. do Thou enrich me with wealth); only this much I ask of
Thee: forgive my sins, because I am a sinner.

(14) If Thou wilt deprive me, who will grant me support? If Thou wilt
drive me out, who will accept me?

(15) Having the book with notes of my wicked deeds under the arm-pit, I
repent like an ass plunged in the mire.

(16) From the water and the mud, (i.e. from ignorance) who will draw me
out (O Merciful Lord!) save Thee? Be Thou Helper unto me for
drawing me out of it and do not let me remain therein.

(17) If shamefully I am replete with sins, do Thou (O God!) sprinkle upon
me water of mercy through Thy grace (i.e. have mercy on me).

(18) If any weak person would fall down and if anyone would help him
holding his hands, that person would stand up again.

(19) Iam that weak, fallen captive of Thine. Therefore, O Lord! mayest

Thou be my helper by showing mercy on me!

At first when the pen began to shake (i.e. began to write), it wrote the
name of the Creator of the World.

(2) (The Almighty Lord is) the bestower of life and soul, and the Lord of
the giver of existence and love.

(3) (Moreover He is) the Lord of Life and Charity, who in the guise of
non-Life created existence.

(4) (That Lord is) Charitable, Merciful, Omnipotent and ever-existing,
(moreover He is) Omniscient and fully cognisant of all creations.

(5) (The Lord is) the Keeper of news (of all matters) and the Knower of
every secret mystery; (He is) the Seer with minuteness and the
Concealer (Keeper) of every kind of sin - fault.

(6) The world, the epoch, the building - all these are owing to Him; the
being of the entire creation is His gift.

(7) In all the creations of that Lord the sky is something like a mole and
amongst all the luminaries created by Him the Sun is like an atom.

(8) | Hecreated the entire world by His Wisdom and thus made known His


--- Page 357 ---

Endless Power.

(9) Anything whatever that exists on the land, and in the sea, hopes for
the gift of the Almighty.

(10) He created the soul, the body, the mind, and the life, and created
wisdom in the bodies of men.

(11) The Almighty Lord who is Omnsicient and unequalled granted man
wisdom, knowledge, intelligence, faculty of thinking and religion.

(12) (That Lord is) the Sovereign without comparison and the unparalleled
judge; around Him destruction never turns up, i.e. He will be for ever
till eternity.

(1) A true Prophet whose religion is brighter than the Sun was sent by
God, with the Book of Religion.

(2) (He is) the Prophet sent by God, the Creator of Life, and the Lord of
the miracles, proofs, and Religion.

(3) He is the best among the Saints (i.e. among the friends) of God and
the most perfect amongst all the prophets and the indicator of the path

of _ to all _ _

(4) He is the Lord of Wisdom and of the good religion, by whom the



--- Page 358 ---

grandeur enlivened in (the whole) world.

(5) Spitaman Zartosht is approved by God, let there be a thousand praises
on his soul.

(6) May there be a dedication of the lives of all our devotees to him! As
the entire world is like the body, and he (i.e. Holy Zartosht), is like
the soul.

(7) Light was created by him in the world and the key to the closed (or
confused) knots was found; (i.e. through the proclamation of his
Religion the explanation of all the difficult matters was gained).

(8) | The Prophet Zartosht removed from the world all pollution (and evils
of the daevas and drujas) and made the world brilliant like the sun.

(9) By showing the path of the Religion of the Creator and the Nourisher
to the people of the world, his Religion was made known everywhere.

(10) The Prophet Zaratosht by getting rid of irreligiousness, deviation
from the right path, showed the path of Righteousness and
commenced the belief in one God only.

(11) That person who abides by the path shown by the Prophet without
doubt, will never suffer grief in both the worlds.

(12) That person will go with (the white mouth) bright, cheerful face in
this world and in the world beyond, and whatever wishes of the heart
he will have will be fulfilled.


--- Page 359 ---

(13) Moreover, that person will lead his life with glory in this world, and
will attain the highest Heaven in the Spiritual World.

(14) May there be a thousand salutations and thousand praises from us to
the Sovereign of the Righteous (i.e. to the Holy Prophet Zartosht)!
