5,"and Jesse begot David the king; and David begot Solomon, of the wife of Uriah; ",selected_bible_verses
6,and Solomon begot Rehoboam; and Rehoboam begot Abijah; and Abijah begot Asa; ,selected_bible_verses

10,"and Josiah begot Jeconiah and his brothers, at the time of the removal to Babylon. ",selected_bible_verses
11,"And after the removal to Babylon, Jeconiah begot Salathiel; and Salathiel begot Zerubbabel; ",selected_bible_verses
12,and Zerubbabel begot Abiud; and Abiud begot Eliakim; and Eliakim begot Azor; ,selected_bible_verses
13,and Azor begot Zadock; and Zadock begot Achim; and Achim begot Eliud; ,selected_bible_verses
14,and Eliud begot Eleazar; and Eleazar begot Matthan; and Matthan begot Jacob; ,selected_bible_verses
15,"and Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.  ",selected_bible_verses
16,"All the generations, therefore, from Abraham unto David are fourteen generations; and from David unto the removal to Babylon, fourteen generations; and from the removal to Babylon unto the Christ, fourteen generations.  ",selected_bible_verses
17,"Now the birth of Jesus Christ was after this manner. His mother Mary having been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found with child by the Holy Spirit. ",selected_bible_verses
18,"But while he thought on these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying: Joseph, son of David, fear not to take to thee Mary thy wife; for that which is begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit. ",selected_bible_verses
19,"And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus; for he shall save his people from their sins.  ",selected_bible_verses
20,"And all this has come to pass, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying:      ",selected_bible_verses
21,"And Joseph, awaking from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord bade him, and took to him his wife; ",selected_bible_verses
22,"saying: Where is he that is born King of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east, and came to do him homage. ",selected_bible_verses
23,"And the king, Herod, hearing it, was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. ",selected_bible_verses
24,"And having assembled all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ should be born. ",selected_bible_verses
25,And they said to him: In Bethlehem of Judaea; for thus it is written by the prophet:      ,selected_bible_verses
26,"And thou Bethlehem, land of Judah,     Art by no means least among the princes of Judah;     For out of thee shall come forth a Governor,     Who shall rule my people Israel.  ",selected_bible_verses
27,"Then Herod, having secretly called the wise men, inquired of them exactly the time of the appearing of the star. ",selected_bible_verses
28,"And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said: Go and inquire strictly concerning the child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I also may come and do him homage. ",selected_bible_verses
29,"And they, having heard the king, departed; and lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the child was. ",selected_bible_verses
30,"And seeing the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. ",selected_bible_verses
31,"And coming into the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and did homage to him; and opening their treasures, they presented to him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh. ",selected_bible_verses
32,"And being warned by God in a dream, not to return to Herod, they departed into their own country by another way.  ",selected_bible_verses
33,"And when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appears to Joseph in a dream, saying: Arise, and take the child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be there until I bring thee word; for Herod is about to seek the child to destroy him. ",selected_bible_verses
34,"And he arose and took the child and his mother by night and departed into Egypt, ",selected_bible_verses
35,"and was there until the death of Herod; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying: Out of Egypt I called my son.  ",selected_bible_verses
36,"Then Herod, seeing that he was mocked by the wise men, was exceedingly enraged; and he sent forth, and slew all the male children that were in Bethlehem, and in all its borders, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had exactly learned from the wise men. ",selected_bible_verses
37,"Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying:      ",selected_bible_verses
38,"But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appears in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, ",selected_bible_verses
39,"saying: Arise, and take the child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel; for they are dead who sought the child's life. ",selected_bible_verses
40,"And he arose, and took the child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel. ",selected_bible_verses
41,"But hearing that Archelaus reigned in Judaea instead of Herod his father, he was afraid to go thither; and being warned by God in a dream, he retired into the region of Galilee. ",selected_bible_verses
42,"And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets: He shall be called a Nazarene.    III.  IN those days comes John the Immerser, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea, ",selected_bible_verses
43,"and saying: Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. ",selected_bible_verses
44,"For this is he that was spoken of through the prophet Isaiah, saying:      The voice of one crying in the wilderness,     Prepare the way of the Lord,     Make straight his paths.  ",selected_bible_verses
45,"And he, John, had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his food was locusts and wild honey.  ",selected_bible_verses
46,"Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region about the Jordan; ",selected_bible_verses
47,"and they were immersed by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins. ",selected_bible_verses
48,"But seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his immersion, he said to them: Brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? ",selected_bible_verses
49,Bring forth therefore fruit worthy of repentance; ,selected_bible_verses
50,"and think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for our father; for I say to you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham. ",selected_bible_verses
51,"And already the axe is laid to the root of the trees; therefore every tree that brings not forth good fruit is cut down, and cast into the fire. ",selected_bible_verses
52,"I indeed immerse you in water unto repentance; but he that comes after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to bear; he will immerse you in the Holy Spirit and fire; ",selected_bible_verses
53,"whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing-floor, and will gather his wheat into the garner; but the chaff he will burn up with fire unquenchable.  ",selected_bible_verses
54,"Then Jesus comes from Galilee to the Jordan, to John, to be immersed by him. ",selected_bible_verses
55,"But John sought to hinder him, saying: I have need to be immersed by thee, and dost thou come to me? ",selected_bible_verses
56,And Jesus answering said to him: Suffer it now; for thus it becomes us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he suffered him. ,selected_bible_verses
57,"And having been immersed, Jesus went up immediately from the water; and lo, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending, as a dove, and coming upon him. ",selected_bible_verses
58,"And lo, a voice out of heaven, saying: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.    IV.  THEN Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness, to be tempted by the Devil. ",selected_bible_verses
59,"And having fasted forty days and forty nights, he afterwards hungered. ",selected_bible_verses
60,"And coming to him, the tempter said: If thou art the Son of God, command that these stones become loaves of bread. ",selected_bible_verses
61,"But he answering said: It is written, Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.  ",selected_bible_verses
62,"Then the Devil takes him into the holy city, and sets him on the pinnacle of the temple, ",selected_bible_verses
63,"and says to him: If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down; for it is written:      He will give his angels command concerning thee;     And on their hands they will bear thee up,     Lest haply thou dash thy foot against a stone.  ",selected_bible_verses
64,"Jesus said to him: Again it is written, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.  ",selected_bible_verses
65,"Again the Devil takes him into an exceedingly high mountain, and shows him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; ",selected_bible_verses
66,"and says to him: All these things I will give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me. ",selected_bible_verses
67,"Then Jesus says to him: Get thee hence, Satan; for it is written: Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. ",selected_bible_verses
68,"Then the Devil leaves him; and behold, angels came and ministered to him.  ",selected_bible_verses
69,"And hearing that John was delivered up, he retired into Galilee. ",selected_bible_verses
70,"And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali; ",selected_bible_verses
71,"that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying:      ",selected_bible_verses
72,"The land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali,     By the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan,     Galilee of the Gentiles,     ",selected_bible_verses
73,"The people that sat in darkness, saw great light,     And to those sitting in the region and shadow of death light sprang up.  ",selected_bible_verses
74,"From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say: Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. ",selected_bible_verses
75,"And walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen. ",selected_bible_verses
76,"And he says to them: Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men. ",selected_bible_verses
77,"And they, immediately leaving the nets, followed him. ",selected_bible_verses
78,"And going on from thence, he saw other two brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them. ",selected_bible_verses
79,"And they, immediately leaving the ship and their father, followed him.  ",selected_bible_verses
80,"And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every infirmity among the people. ",selected_bible_verses
81,"And his fame went forth into all Syria; and they brought to him all that were sick, taken with divers diseases and torments, and possessed with demons, and lunatic, and palsied; and he healed them. ",selected_bible_verses
82,"And great multitudes followed him from Galilee, and Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judaea, and from beyond the Jordan.    V.  AND seeing the multitudes, he went up into the mountain; and he having sat down, his disciples came to him. ",selected_bible_verses
83,"And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying:  ",selected_bible_verses
84,Happy the poor in spirit; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.  ,selected_bible_verses
85,Happy they that mourn; for they shall be comforted.  ,selected_bible_verses
86,Happy they that hunger and thirst after righteousness; for they shall be filled.  ,selected_bible_verses
87,Happy the merciful; for they shall obtain mercy.  ,selected_bible_verses
88,Happy the pure in heart; for they shall see God.  ,selected_bible_verses
89,Happy the peacemakers; for they shall be called sons of God.  ,selected_bible_verses
90,Happy they who are persecuted for righteousness' sake; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.  ,selected_bible_verses
91,"Rejoice, and exult; because great is your reward in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets that were before you.  ",selected_bible_verses
92,"Ye are the salt of the earth; but if the salt become tasteless, wherewith shall it be salted? It is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot by men.  ",selected_bible_verses
93,Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill can not be hid. ,selected_bible_verses
94,"Nor do they light a lamp and put it under the bushel, but on the lamp-stand; and it shines to all that are in the house. ",selected_bible_verses
95,"Thus let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.  ",selected_bible_verses
96,"Think not that I came to destroy the law, or the prophets; I came not to destroy, but to fulfill. ",selected_bible_verses
97,"For verily I say to you, till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall not pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. ",selected_bible_verses
98,"Whoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever shall do and teach them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.  ",selected_bible_verses
99,"For I say to you, that except your righteousness shall exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.  ",selected_bible_verses
100,"Therefore if thou bringest thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother has aught against thee; ",selected_bible_verses
101,"leave there thy gift before the altar, and go, first be reconciled to thy brother and then come and offer thy gift.  ",selected_bible_verses
102,"Agree with thine adversary quickly, while thou art in the way with him; lest haply the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison. ",selected_bible_verses
103,"Verily I say to thee, thou shalt not come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.  ",selected_bible_verses
104,Ye heard that it was said: Thou shalt not commit adultery. ,selected_bible_verses
105,"But I say to you, that every one who looks on a woman, to lust after her, has already committed adultery with her in his heart. ",selected_bible_verses
106,"And if thy right eye causes thee to offend, pluck it out and cast it from thee; for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members perish, and not thy whole body be cast into hell. ",selected_bible_verses
107,"And if thy right hand causes thee to offend, cut it off and cast it from thee; for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members perish, and not thy whole body be cast into hell.  ",selected_bible_verses
108,"And it was said: Whoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement. ",selected_bible_verses
109,"But I say to you, that whoever shall put away his wife, save for the cause of fornication, makes her commit adultery; and whoever shall marry her when put away, commits adultery.  ",selected_bible_verses
110,"But I say to you, swear not at all; neither by heaven, for it is God's throne; ",selected_bible_verses
111,"nor by the earth, for it is his footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. ",selected_bible_verses
112,Nor shalt thou swear by thy head; because thou canst not make one hair white or black. ,selected_bible_verses
113,"But let your word be, Yea, yea, Nay, nay; for that which is more than these comes of evil.  ",selected_bible_verses
114,"Ye heard that it was said: An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. ",selected_bible_verses
115,"But I say to you, that ye resist not evil; but whoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. ",selected_bible_verses
116,"And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take thy coat, let him have thy cloak also. ",selected_bible_verses
117,"And whoever shall compel thee to go one mile, go with him two. ",selected_bible_verses
118,"Give to him that asks of thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not away.  ",selected_bible_verses
119,"Ye heard that it was said: Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and shalt hate thine enemy. ",selected_bible_verses
120,"But I say to you, love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you; ",selected_bible_verses
121,"that ye may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for he causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust. ",selected_bible_verses
122,"For if ye love those who love you, what reward have ye? Do not also the publicans the same? ",selected_bible_verses
123,"And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye that excels? Do not also the heathen thus? ",selected_bible_verses
124,"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father who is in heaven is perfect.    VI.  TAKE heed that ye do not your righteousness before men, to be seen by them; otherwise ye have no reward with your Father who is in heaven. ",selected_bible_verses
125,"Therefore when thou doest alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say to you, they have in full their reward. ",selected_bible_verses
126,"But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand does; ",selected_bible_verses
127,that thine aims may be in secret and thy Father who sees in secret will himself reward thee.  ,selected_bible_verses
128,"And when ye pray, ye shall not be as the hypocrites; for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Verily I say to you, they have in full their reward. ",selected_bible_verses
129,"But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and having shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret; and thy Father who sees in secret will reward thee.  ",selected_bible_verses
130,"But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do; for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. ",selected_bible_verses
131,"Be not ye therefore like to them; for your Father knows what things ye have need of, before ye ask him. ",selected_bible_verses
132,"Do ye, therefore, pray after this manner:  Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.  ",selected_bible_verses
133,"Thy kingdom come; thy will be done, as in heaven, so also on the earth.  ",selected_bible_verses
134,"And forgive us our debts, as also we forgave our debtors.  ",selected_bible_verses
135,"For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; ",selected_bible_verses
136,"but if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.  ",selected_bible_verses
137,"And when ye fast, be not as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance; for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear to men to fast. Verily I say to you, they have in full their reward. ",selected_bible_verses
138,"But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thy head, and wash thy face; ",selected_bible_verses
139,"that thou appear not to men to fast, but to thy Father who is in secret; and thy Father who sees in secret will reward thee.  ",selected_bible_verses
140,"Lay not up for yourselves treasures on the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break through and steal. ",selected_bible_verses
141,"But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes, and where thieves do not break through nor steal. ",selected_bible_verses
142,"For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.  ",selected_bible_verses
143,"The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body will be light; ",selected_bible_verses
144,"but if thine eye be evil, thy whole body will be dark. If therefore the light that is in thee is darkness, how great the darkness! ",selected_bible_verses
145,"No man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one, and love the other, or he will hold to one and despise the other. Ye can not serve God and Mammon.  ",selected_bible_verses
146,"For this cause I say to you, take not thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than food, and the body than raiment? ",selected_bible_verses
147,"Behold the birds of the air, that they sow not, nor reap, nor gather into barns; and your heavenly Father feeds them. Are ye not much better than they? ",selected_bible_verses
148,"And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. They toil not, nor spin; ",selected_bible_verses
149,"and I say to you, that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. ",selected_bible_verses
150,"And if God so clothes the grass of the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven, will he not much more you, ye of little faith? ",selected_bible_verses
151,"Take not thought therefore, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewith shall we be clothed? ",selected_bible_verses
152,For after all these do the Gentiles seek. For your heavenly Father knows that ye have need of all these. ,selected_bible_verses
153,"But seek first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these shall be added to you. ",selected_bible_verses
154,"Take not thought, therefore, for the morrow; for the morrow will take thought for itself. Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.    VII.  JUDGE not, that ye be not judged. ",selected_bible_verses
155,"For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you. ",selected_bible_verses
156,"And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye? ",selected_bible_verses
157,"Or how wilt thou say to thy brother: Let me cast out the mote from thine eye; and behold, the beam is in thine own eye? ",selected_bible_verses
158,Hypocrite! first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then thou wilt see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.  ,selected_bible_verses
159,"Give not that which is holy to the dogs, nor cast your pearls before the swine; lest they trample them with their feet, and turn and rend you.  ",selected_bible_verses
160,"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you. ",selected_bible_verses
161,For every one that asks receives; and he that seeks finds; and to him that knocks it shall be opened. ,selected_bible_verses
162,"Or what man is there of you, of whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone? ",selected_bible_verses
163,"And if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent? ",selected_bible_verses
164,"If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him? ",selected_bible_verses
165,"Therefore all things whatever ye would that men should do to you, so also do ye to them; for this is the law and the prophets.  ",selected_bible_verses
166,"Enter in through the strait gate; because wide is the gate, and broad the way, that leads to destruction, and many are they who go in thereat. ",selected_bible_verses
167,"Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheeps' clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves.  ",selected_bible_verses
168,"Ye shall know them from their fruits. Do men gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles? ",selected_bible_verses
169,So every good tree brings forth good fruit; but the corrupt tree brings forth evil fruit. ,selected_bible_verses
170,"A good tree can not bring forth evil fruit, nor a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. ",selected_bible_verses
171,"Every tree that brings not forth good fruit is cut down, and cast into the fire. ",selected_bible_verses
172,"So then, from their fruits ye shall know them.  ",selected_bible_verses
173,"Not every one that says to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that does the will of my Father who is in heaven. ",selected_bible_verses
174,"Many will say to me in that day: Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in thy name, and in thy name cast out demons, and in thy name do many miracles? ",selected_bible_verses
175,"And then will I profess to them, I never knew you; depart from me, ye who work iniquity.  ",selected_bible_verses
176,"And the rain descended, and the streams came, and the winds blew, and fell upon that house; and it did not fall, for it had been founded on the rock. ",selected_bible_verses
177,"And every one who hears these sayings of mine, and does them not, shall be likened to a foolish man, who built his house on the sand. ",selected_bible_verses
178,"And the rain descended, and the streams came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, and it fell; and great was the fall of it.  ",selected_bible_verses
179,"And it came to pass, when Jesus ended these sayings, that the multitudes were astonished at his teaching. ",selected_bible_verses
180,"For he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.    VIII.  WHEN he had come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him. ",selected_bible_verses
181,"And, behold, there came a leper and bowed down to him, saying: Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst cleanse me. ",selected_bible_verses
182,"And stretching forth his hand, he touched him, saying: I will; be thou cleansed. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. ",selected_bible_verses
183,"And Jesus says to him: See thou tell no one; but go, show thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.  ",selected_bible_verses
184,"And as he entered into Capernaum, there came to him a centurion, beseeching him, ",selected_bible_verses
185,"and saying: Lord, my servant lies at home palsied, grievously tormented. ",selected_bible_verses
186,And Jesus says to him: I will come and heal him. ,selected_bible_verses
187,"The centurion answered and said: Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldst come under my roof; but only say in a word, and my servant will be healed. ",selected_bible_verses
188,"For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me, and I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it. ",selected_bible_verses
189,"And Jesus hearing it marveled, and said to those who followed: Verily I say to you, I found not so great faith, even in Israel. ",selected_bible_verses
190,"And I say to you, that many will come from the east and west, and will recline at table, with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven; ",selected_bible_verses
191,"but the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into the outer darkness. There will be the weeping, and the gnashing of teeth! ",selected_bible_verses
192,"And Jesus said to the centurion: Go thy way; and as thou didst believe, be it done to thee. And his servant was healed in that hour.  ",selected_bible_verses
193,"And Jesus, coming into the house of Peter, saw his mother-in-law lying, and sick with fever. ",selected_bible_verses
194,"And he touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she arose, and ministered to him. ",selected_bible_verses
195,"When evening was come, they brought to him many that were possessed with demons; and he cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all that were sick; ",selected_bible_verses
196,"that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying: Himself took our infirmities, and bore our sicknesses.  ",selected_bible_verses
197,"And Jesus, seeing great multitudes about him, commanded to depart to the other side. ",selected_bible_verses

287,"And John, having heard in the prison the works of the Christ, sent by his disciples, ",selected_bible_verses

291,"And happy is he, whoever shall not be offended at me.  ",selected_bible_verses
292,"And as these were departing, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John: What went ye out into the wilderness to behold? A reed shaken by the wind?  ",selected_bible_verses
293,"But what went ye out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they who wear soft clothing are in king's houses.  ",selected_bible_verses
294,"For this is he of whom it is written:      Behold, I send forth my messenger before thy face,     Who shall prepare thy way before thee.  ",selected_bible_verses
295,"Verily I say to you, among those born of women, there has not risen a greater than John the Immerser. But he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.  ",selected_bible_verses

301,"and say: We piped to you, and ye danced not; we sang the lament, and ye did not beat the breast. ",selected_bible_verses
302,"For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say: He has a demon. ",selected_bible_verses
303,"The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say: Behold a glutton and a wine-drinker, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom was justified on the part of her children.  ",selected_bible_verses
304,"Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his miracles were done, because they repented not. ",selected_bible_verses
305,"Woe to thee, Chorazin! Woe to thee, Bethsaida! For if the miracles, that were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. ",selected_bible_verses
306,"But I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment, than for you.  ",selected_bible_verses
307,"But I say to you, that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.  ",selected_bible_verses

313,"For my yoke is easy, and my burden light.    XII.  AT that time Jesus went on the sabbath through the grain-fields; and his disciples were hungry, and began to pluck ears of grain, and to eat. ",selected_bible_verses
314,"And the Pharisees seeing it said to him: Behold, thy disciples are doing that which it is not lawful to do on the sabbath. ",selected_bible_verses
315,"And he said to them: Have ye not read what David did, when he hungered, himself and those with him; ",selected_bible_verses
316,"how he entered into the house of God, and ate the show-bread, which it was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those with him, but for the priests alone? ",selected_bible_verses
317,"Or have ye not read in the law, that on the sabbath the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless? ",selected_bible_verses
318,"But I say to you, that a greater than the temple is here. ",selected_bible_verses
319,"But if ye had known what this means, I desire mercy and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the blameless. ",selected_bible_verses
320,For the Son of man is Lord of the sabbath.  ,selected_bible_verses
321,"And departing from thence, he went into their synagogue. ",selected_bible_verses
322,"And behold, there was a man, having his hand withered. And they asked him, saying: Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath? that they might accuse him. ",selected_bible_verses
323,"And he said to them: What man will there be of you, that shall have one sheep, and if this fall into a pit on the sabbath, will not lay hold of it, and raise it up? ",selected_bible_verses
324,How much better then is a man than a sheep! So that it is lawful to do well on the sabbath. ,selected_bible_verses
325,"Then he says to the man: Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, as the other.  ",selected_bible_verses
326,"And the Pharisees went out, and took counsel against him, how they might destroy him. ",selected_bible_verses
327,"But Jesus, knowing it, withdrew from thence; and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all. ",selected_bible_verses
328,And he charged them that they should not make him known; ,selected_bible_verses
329,"that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying:      ",selected_bible_verses
330,"Behold my servant, whom I chose,     My beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased.     I will put my spirit upon him,     And he will declare judgment to the Gentiles.     ",selected_bible_verses
331,"He will not strive, nor cry;     Nor will any one hear his voice in the streets.     ",selected_bible_verses
332,"A bruised reed he will not break,     And smoking flax he will not quench,     Till he send forth judgment unto victory.     ",selected_bible_verses
333,And in his name will Gentiles hope.  ,selected_bible_verses
334,"And all the multitudes were amazed, and said: Is this the Son of David? ",selected_bible_verses
335,"But the Pharisees hearing it said: This man does not cast out the demons, except through Beelzebul, prince of the demons. ",selected_bible_verses
336,"And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them: Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and any city or house divided against itself shall not stand. ",selected_bible_verses
337,"And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom stand? ",selected_bible_verses
338,"And if I through Beelzebul cast out the demons, through whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges. ",selected_bible_verses
339,"But if I through the Spirit of God cast out the demons, then is the kingdom of God come near to you. ",selected_bible_verses
340,"Or how can any one enter into a strong man's house, and seize upon his goods, except he first bind the strong man? And then he will plunder his house.  ",selected_bible_verses
341,He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathers not with me scatters abroad.  ,selected_bible_verses
342,"Therefore I say to you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven to men; but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. ",selected_bible_verses
343,"And whoever speaks a word against the Son of man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in that which is to come.  ",selected_bible_verses
344,"Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt; for from the fruit the tree is known.  ",selected_bible_verses
345,"Brood of vipers! How can ye, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. ",selected_bible_verses
346,The good man out of the good treasure sends forth good things; and the evil man out of the evil treasure sends forth evil things. ,selected_bible_verses
347,"But I say to you, that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. ",selected_bible_verses
348,"For from thy words thou shalt be justified, and from thy words thou shalt be condemned.  ",selected_bible_verses
349,"Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered him saying: Teacher, we desire to see a sign from thee. ",selected_bible_verses
350,"But he answering said to them: An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and no sign shall be given to it, but the sign of Jonah the prophet. ",selected_bible_verses
351,"For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the fish, so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. ",selected_bible_verses
352,"Men of Nineveh will rise in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it; because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, a greater than Jonah is here. ",selected_bible_verses
353,"A queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it; for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, a greater than Solomon is here.  ",selected_bible_verses
354,"But when the unclean spirit is gone out from the man, he goes through dry places seeking rest, and finds it not. ",selected_bible_verses
355,"Then he says, I will return into my house from whence I came out and coming he finds it empty, swept, and set in order. ",selected_bible_verses
356,"Then he goes, and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there; and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. So shall it be also with this wicked generation.  ",selected_bible_verses
357,"While he was yet speaking to the multitudes, behold, his mother and his brothers were standing without, seeking to speak to him. ",selected_bible_verses
358,"And one said to him: Behold, thy mother and thy brothers are standing without, seeking to speak to thee. ",selected_bible_verses
359,"But he answering said to him that told him: Who is my mother, and who are my brothers? ",selected_bible_verses
360,"And stretching forth his hand toward his disciples, he said: Behold my mother and my brothers! ",selected_bible_verses
361,"For whoever shall do the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.    XIII.  AND on that day Jesus went out of the house, and sat by the sea-side. ",selected_bible_verses
362,"And great multitudes were gathered together to him, so that he went into the ship and sat down; and all the multitude stood on the beach. ",selected_bible_verses
363,"And he spoke many things to them in parables, saying:  ",selected_bible_verses
364,"Behold, the sower went forth to sow. And as he sowed, some fell by the way-side, and the birds came and devoured them. ",selected_bible_verses
365,"And others fell on the rocky places, where they had not much earth; and forthwith they sprang up, because they had not depth of earth. ",selected_bible_verses
366,"And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had not root, they withered away. ",selected_bible_verses
367,"And others fell upon the thorns; and the thorns came up, and choked them. ",selected_bible_verses
368,"And others fell on the good ground, and yielded fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. ",selected_bible_verses
369,And the disciples came and said to him: Why dost thou speak to them in parables? ,selected_bible_verses
370,"For whoever has, to him shall be given, and he shall have abundance; but whoever has not, even what he has shall be taken from him. ",selected_bible_verses
371,"Therefore I speak to them in parables; because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, nor understand. ",selected_bible_verses
372,"And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which says:      With the hearing ye will hear, and will not understand;     And seeing ye will see, and will not perceive.     ",selected_bible_verses
373,"For the heart of this people is become gross,     And their ears are dull of hearing,     And their eyes they have closed;     Lest haply they see with their eyes,     And hear with their ears,     And understand with their heart,     And turn, and I shall heal them.  ",selected_bible_verses
374,"But happy are your eyes, because they see; and your ears, because they hear. ",selected_bible_verses
375,"For verily I say to you, that many prophets and righteous men desired to see what ye are beholding, and did not see, and to hear what ye are hearing, and did not hear.  ",selected_bible_verses
376,Hear therefore the parable of the sower. ,selected_bible_verses
377,"When any one hears the word of the kingdom, and understands not, then comes the evil one and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is that which was sown by the way-side.  ",selected_bible_verses
378,"And that sown on the rocky places, this is he that hears the word, and immediately with joy receives it; ",selected_bible_verses
379,"and has not root in himself, but is only for a time; and when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he is offended.  ",selected_bible_verses
380,"And that sown among the thorns, this is he that hears the word, and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful. ",selected_bible_verses
381,"And that sown on the good ground, this is he that hears the word and understands; who bears fruit, and produces, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.  ",selected_bible_verses
382,"Another parable he put forth to them, saying: The kingdom of heaven is likened to a man that sowed good seed in his field. ",selected_bible_verses
383,"But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed darnel among the wheat, and went away. ",selected_bible_verses
384,"And when the blade sprang up and produced fruit, then appeared the darnel also. ",selected_bible_verses
385,"And the servants of the householder came and said to him: Sir, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? From whence then has it darnel? ",selected_bible_verses
386,He said to them: An enemy did this. The servants said to him: Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? ,selected_bible_verses
387,"He said: Nay, lest while ye gather up the darnel, ye root up the wheat with them. ",selected_bible_verses
388,"Let both grow together until the harvest. And in time of harvest I will say to the reapers: Gather up first the darnel, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.  ",selected_bible_verses
389,"Another parable he put forth to them, saying: The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard, which a man took and sowed in his field. ",selected_bible_verses
390,"Which is the least indeed of all seeds; but when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its branches.  ",selected_bible_verses
391,"Another parable he spoke to them: The kingdom of heaven is like to leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.  ",selected_bible_verses
392,All these things Jesus spoke to the multitudes in parables; and without a parable he spoke nothing to them; ,selected_bible_verses
393,"that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying:      I will open my mouth in parables;     I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.  ",selected_bible_verses
394,And answering he said to them:  He that sows the good seed is the Son of man. ,selected_bible_verses
395,"The field is the world. The good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; but the darnel are the sons of the evil one, ",selected_bible_verses
396,and the enemy that sowed them is the Devil. The harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are angels. ,selected_bible_verses
397,"As therefore the darnel are gathered up and are burned with fire, so shall it be in the end of the world. ",selected_bible_verses
398,"The Son of man will send forth his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all the causes of offense, and those who do iniquity, ",selected_bible_verses
399,"and will cast them into the furnace of fire; there will be the wailing, and the gnashing of teeth! ",selected_bible_verses
400,"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like to a merchant seeking goodly pearls; ",selected_bible_verses
401,"and having found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it.  ",selected_bible_verses
402,"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like to a net, cast into the sea, and gathering together of every kind. ",selected_bible_verses
403,"Which, when it was filled, they drew up upon the beach, and sat down and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away. ",selected_bible_verses
404,"So will it be in the end of the world. The angels will go forth, and will separate the wicked from among the just, ",selected_bible_verses
405,"and will cast them into the furnace of fire; there will be the wailing, and the gnashing of teeth!  ",selected_bible_verses
406,"Did ye understand all these things? They say to him, Yea, Lord. ",selected_bible_verses
407,"And he said to them: Therefore every scribe, instructed in the kingdom of heaven, is like to a householder, who brings forth out of his treasure new and old.  ",selected_bible_verses
408,"And it came to pass, when Jesus finished these parables, that he departed thence. ",selected_bible_verses
409,"And coming into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue; so that they were astonished, and said: Whence has this man this wisdom, and the miracles? Is not this the carpenter's son? ",selected_bible_verses
410,"And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then has this man all these things? ",selected_bible_verses
411,"And they were offended at him. But Jesus said to them: A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country, and in his own house.  ",selected_bible_verses
412,"And he did not many miracles there, because of their unbelief.    XIV.  AT that time Herod the tetrarch heard the fame of Jesus. ",selected_bible_verses
413,"For Herod laid hold of John, and bound him and put him in prison, for the sake of Herodias, the wife of Philip, his brother. ",selected_bible_verses
414,For John said to him: It is not lawful for thee to have her. ,selected_bible_verses
415,"And though desiring to put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they held him as a prophet. ",selected_bible_verses
416,"But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod. ",selected_bible_verses
417,"Whereupon he promised with an oath, to give her whatever she should ask. ",selected_bible_verses
418,"And she, being urged on by her mother, says: Give me here, on a platter, the head of John the Immerser. ",selected_bible_verses
419,"And the king was sorry; but for the sake of the oath, and of those who reclined at table with him, he commanded it to be given. ",selected_bible_verses
420,"And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison. ",selected_bible_verses
421,"And his head was brought on a platter, and was given to the damsel, and she brought it to her mother. ",selected_bible_verses
422,"And his disciples came and took up the body, and buried it; and they went and reported it to Jesus.  ",selected_bible_verses
423,"And when Jesus heard it, he withdrew from thence by ship, into a desert place apart. And the multitudes hearing of it, followed him on foot from the cities. ",selected_bible_verses
424,"And going forth he saw a great multitude, and had compassion on them, and he healed their sick.  ",selected_bible_verses
425,"And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying: The place is desert, and the time is already passed away; dismiss the multitudes, that they may go away into the villages, and buy themselves victuals. ",selected_bible_verses
426,But Jesus said to them: They need not go away; give ye them to eat. ,selected_bible_verses
427,"And they say to him: We have here but five loaves, and two fishes. ",selected_bible_verses
428,He said: Bring them hither to me. ,selected_bible_verses
429,"And he commanded that the multitudes should lie down on the grass, and took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven he blessed, and broke, and gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes. ",selected_bible_verses
430,"And they all ate, and were filled; and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full. ",selected_bible_verses
431,"And they who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.  ",selected_bible_verses
432,"And straightway he constrained his disciples to enter into the ship, and to go before him to the other side, while he dismissed the multitudes.  ",selected_bible_verses
433,"And having dismissed the multitudes, he went up into the mountain apart to pray; and when evening was come, he was there alone. ",selected_bible_verses
434,"But the ship was already in the midst of the sea, vexed by the waves; for the wind was contrary. ",selected_bible_verses
435,"And in the fourth watch of the night he went to them, walking on the sea. ",selected_bible_verses
436,"And the disciples, seeing him walking on the sea, were troubled, saying: It is a spectre. And they cried out for fear. ",selected_bible_verses
437,"But straightway Jesus spoke to them, saying: Be of good cheer; it is I, be not afraid. ",selected_bible_verses
438,"And Peter answering him said: Lord, if it is thou, bid me come to thee on the water. ",selected_bible_verses
439,"And he said: Come. And coming down from the ship, Peter walked on the water, to go to Jesus. ",selected_bible_verses
440,"But seeing the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying: Lord, save me. ",selected_bible_verses
441,"And immediately Jesus, stretching forth his hand, took hold of him, and said to him: Thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?  ",selected_bible_verses
442,"And when they had entered into the ship, the wind ceased. ",selected_bible_verses
443,"And passing over, they came into the land of Gennesaret. ",selected_bible_verses
444,"And the men of that place, knowing him, sent out into all that country round, and brought to him all that were diseased ",selected_bible_verses
445,"and besought him that they might only touch the fringe of his garment; and as many as touched were made whole.    XV.  THEN there come to Jesus the scribes and Pharisees from Jerusalem, saying: ",selected_bible_verses
446,Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they wash not their hands when they eat bread. ,selected_bible_verses
447,"And he answering said to them: Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God, for the sake of your tradition? ",selected_bible_verses
448,"But ye say: Whoever says to his father or his mother, It is a gift, whatever thou mightest be profited with from me, ",selected_bible_verses
449,"Hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying:      ",selected_bible_verses
450,"This people honor me with their lips,     But their heart is far from me.     ",selected_bible_verses
451,"But in vain they worship me,     Teaching as doctrines commandments of men.  ",selected_bible_verses
452,"And calling to him the multitude, he said to them: Hear, and understand: ",selected_bible_verses
453,"Not that which enters into the mouth defiles the man; but that which comes out of the mouth, this defiles the man.  ",selected_bible_verses
454,"Then came to him his disciples, and said to him: Knowest thou that the Pharisees, when they heard the saying, were offended? ",selected_bible_verses
455,"And he answering said: Every plant, which my heavenly Father planted not, shall be rooted up. ",selected_bible_verses
456,"Let them alone; they are blind leaders of the blind; and if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into the ditch.  ",selected_bible_verses
457,And Peter answering said to him: Explain to us this parable. ,selected_bible_verses
458,And he said: Are ye also even yet without understanding? ,selected_bible_verses
459,"Do ye not yet understand, that whatever enters into the mouth goes into the belly, and is cast out into the drain? ",selected_bible_verses
460,But the things that proceed out of the mouth come forth out of the heart; and they defile the man. ,selected_bible_verses
461,"For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false-witnessings, blasphemies. ",selected_bible_verses
462,These are the things that defile the man; but to eat with unwashen hands defiles not the man.  ,selected_bible_verses
463,"And Jesus, going forth from thence, withdrew into the region of Tyre and Sidon. ",selected_bible_verses
464,"And behold, a woman of Canaan, coming out from those borders, cried to him, saying: Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David; my daughter is grievously possessed with a demon. ",selected_bible_verses
465,"But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying: Dismiss her; because she cries after us. ",selected_bible_verses
466,But he answering said: I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. ,selected_bible_verses
467,"But she came and bowed down to him, saying: Lord, help me. ",selected_bible_verses
468,"But he answering said: It is not good to take the children's bread, and cast it to the dogs. ",selected_bible_verses
469,"And she said: Yea, Lord; for the dogs also eat of the crumbs that fall from their masters' table. ",selected_bible_verses
470,"Then Jesus answering said to her: O woman, great is thy faith; be it done to thee as thou wilt. And her daughter was healed from that hour.  ",selected_bible_verses
471,"And departing from thence, Jesus came near to the sea of Galilee; and going up into the mountain, he sat down there. ",selected_bible_verses
472,"And great multitudes came to him, having with them lame, blind dumb, maimed, and many others, and laid them down at his feet, and he healed them; ",selected_bible_verses
473,"so that the multitudes wondered, when they saw the dumb speaking, the maimed whole, the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.  ",selected_bible_verses
474,"And Jesus, having called to him his disciples, said: I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat; and I will not dismiss them fasting, lest they faint in the way. ",selected_bible_verses
475,"And his disciples say to him: Whence should we have so many loaves in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude? ",selected_bible_verses
476,"And Jesus says to them: How many loaves have ye? And they said: Seven, and a few little fishes. ",selected_bible_verses
477,And he commanded the multitudes to lie down on the ground. ,selected_bible_verses
478,"And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and broke, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude. ",selected_bible_verses
479,"And they all ate, and were filled. And they took up of the fragments that remained seven baskets full. ",selected_bible_verses
480,"And they who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children. ",selected_bible_verses
481,"And dismissing the multitudes, he entered into the ship, and came into the borders of Magdala.    XVI.  AND the Pharisees and Sadducees came to him, and tempting desired him to show them a sign from heaven. ",selected_bible_verses
482,"And he answering said to them: When it is evening, ye say: Fair weather! for the sky is red. ",selected_bible_verses
483,"And in the morning: A storm to-day! for the sky is red and lowering. Ye know how to discern the face of the sky, but can ye not the signs of the times?  ",selected_bible_verses
484,"An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and no sign shall be given to it, but the sign of Jonah. And he left them, and departed.  ",selected_bible_verses
485,"And coming to the other side, his disciples forgot to take bread. ",selected_bible_verses
486,"And Jesus said to them: Take heed, and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees. ",selected_bible_verses
487,"And they reasoned among themselves, saying: Because we took no bread! ",selected_bible_verses
488,"And Jesus knowing it said: Ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye took no bread? ",selected_bible_verses
489,"Do ye not yet understand, nor remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up? ",selected_bible_verses
490,"Nor the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up? ",selected_bible_verses
491,"How is it that ye do not understand, that I spoke not to you of bread? But, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees! ",selected_bible_verses
492,"Then they understood, that he did not bid them beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.  ",selected_bible_verses
493,"And they said: Some, John the Immerser; and others, Elijah; and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.  ",selected_bible_verses
494,He says to them: But who do ye say that I am? ,selected_bible_verses
495,"And Simon Peter answering said: Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. ",selected_bible_verses
496,And I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.  ,selected_bible_verses
497,"Then he charged his disciples, that they should tell no one that he is the Christ.  ",selected_bible_verses
498,"From that time Jesus began to show to his disciples, that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be put to death, and rise on the third day.  ",selected_bible_verses
499,"And Peter taking him aside began to rebuke him, saying: Be it far from thee, Lord; this shall not be to thee. ",selected_bible_verses
500,"Then Jesus said to his disciples: If any one will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. ",selected_bible_verses
501,"For whoever will save his life shall lose it; and whoever may lose his life for my sake, shall find it. ",selected_bible_verses
502,"For the Son of man will come in the glory of his Father, with his angels; and then he will reward each one according to his works.  ",selected_bible_verses
503,"Verily I say to you, there are some of those standing here, who shall not taste death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.    XVII.  AND after six days Jesus takes with him Peter, and James, and John his brother, and brings them up into a high mountain apart. ",selected_bible_verses
504,"And he was transfigured before them; and his face shone as the sun, and his garments became white as the light. ",selected_bible_verses
505,"And behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, talking with him. ",selected_bible_verses
506,"And Peter answering said to Jesus: Lord, it is good for us to be here. If thou wilt, let us make here three tents; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah. ",selected_bible_verses
507,"While he was yet speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them. And behold, a voice out of the cloud, saying: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him. ",selected_bible_verses
508,"And the disciples, hearing it, fell on their face, and were exceedingly afraid. ",selected_bible_verses
509,"And Jesus coming to them touched them, and said: Arise, and be not afraid. ",selected_bible_verses
510,"And lifting up their eyes, they saw no one save Jesus only.  ",selected_bible_verses
511,"And as they came down out of the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying: Tell no one the vision, until the Son of man is risen from the dead.  ",selected_bible_verses
512,"And his disciples asked him, saying: Why then say the scribes that Elijah must first come? ",selected_bible_verses
513,"And he answering said: Elijah indeed comes, and will restore all things. ",selected_bible_verses
514,"But I say to you, that Elijah is already come, and they knew him not, but did with him whatever they would. So also is the Son of man about to suffer by them.  ",selected_bible_verses
515,Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the Immerser.  ,selected_bible_verses
516,"And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a man, kneeling down to him, and saying: ",selected_bible_verses
517,"Lord, have mercy on my son; for he is lunatic, and is sorely afflicted; for ofttimes he falls into the fire, and oft into the water. ",selected_bible_verses
518,"And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him. ",selected_bible_verses
519,"And Jesus answering said: O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him hither to me. ",selected_bible_verses
520,"And Jesus rebuked him; and the demon went out from him, and the child was cured from that hour.  ",selected_bible_verses
521,"Then the disciples, coming to Jesus apart, said: Why could not we cast him out? ",selected_bible_verses
522,"And he said to them: Because of your want of faith. For verily I say to you, if ye have faith as a grain of mustard, ye shall say to this mountain, remove hence to yonder place, and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible to you. ",selected_bible_verses
523,"But this kind goes not forth, except by prayer and fasting.  ",selected_bible_verses
524,"And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said to them: The Son of man is about to be delivered into the hands of men ",selected_bible_verses
525,"and they will put him to death, and he will rise on the third day. And they were exceedingly sorrowful.  ",selected_bible_verses
526,"He says, Yes. And when he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying: What thinkest thou, Simon? Of whom do the kings of the earth take customs, or tribute? Of their sons, or of strangers? ",selected_bible_verses
527,He says to him: Of strangers. Jesus said to him: Then are the sons free. ,selected_bible_verses
528,"But that we may not offend them, go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the fish that first comes up; and opening its mouth thou wilt find a shekel; that take, and give to them for me and thee.    XVIII.  AT that time came the disciples to Jesus, saying: Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?  ",selected_bible_verses
529,"And Jesus, calling a little child to him, placed it in the midst of them, ",selected_bible_verses
530,"and said: Verily I say to you, if ye do not turn and become as the little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. ",selected_bible_verses
531,"Whoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. ",selected_bible_verses
532,"And whoever shall receive one such little child, in my name, receives me. ",selected_bible_verses
533,"But whoever shall cause one of these little ones that believe on me to offend, it were better for him that an upper millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were plunged in the depth of the sea.  ",selected_bible_verses
534,"Woe to the world, for causes of offense! For it must needs be that causes of offense come; but woe to that man, through whom the cause of offense comes! ",selected_bible_verses
535,"But if thy hand or thy foot causes thee to offend, cut it off, and cast it from thee. It is better for thee to enter into life lame or maimed, than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the everlasting fire. ",selected_bible_verses
536,"And if thine eye causes thee to offend, pluck it out and cast it from thee. It is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell-fire.  ",selected_bible_verses
537,"Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say to you, that their angels in heaven always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven. ",selected_bible_verses
538,For the Son of man came to save that which was lost.  ,selected_bible_verses
539,"What think ye? If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them is gone astray, does he not leave the ninety and nine upon the mountains, and go and seek that which is gone astray? ",selected_bible_verses
540,"And if it be that he find it, verily I say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety and nine that went not astray. ",selected_bible_verses
541,"So it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven, that one of these little ones perish.  ",selected_bible_verses
542,"But if thy brother shall sin against thee, go show him his fault between thee and him alone, If he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. ",selected_bible_verses
543,"But if he hear not, take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. ",selected_bible_verses
544,"And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it to the church; and if he neglect to hear the church also, let him be to thee as a heathen and a publican. ",selected_bible_verses
545,Verily I say to you: Whatever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.  ,selected_bible_verses
546,"Again I say to you, that if two of you shall agree on earth, concerning any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them by my Father who is in heaven. ",selected_bible_verses
547,"For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.  ",selected_bible_verses
548,"Then Peter came to him, and said: Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Until seven times? ",selected_bible_verses
549,"Jesus says to him: I say not to thee, until seven times, but until seventy times seven.  ",selected_bible_verses
550,"Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened to a certain king, who desired to make a reckoning with his servants. ",selected_bible_verses
551,"But as he was not able to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made. ",selected_bible_verses
552,"The servant therefore, falling, prostrated himself before him, saying: Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. ",selected_bible_verses
553,"And the lord of that servant, moved with compassion, released him, and forgave him the debt. ",selected_bible_verses
554,"Therefore his fellow-servant fell down and besought him, saying: Have patience with me, and I will pay thee. ",selected_bible_verses
555,"And he would not; but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt. ",selected_bible_verses
556,"And his fellow-servants, seeing what was done, were very sorry, and came and disclosed to their lord all that was done. ",selected_bible_verses
557,"Then having called him, his lord says to him: Thou wicked servant; I forgave thee all that debt, because thou besoughtest me. ",selected_bible_verses
558,"Shouldest not thou also have had pity on thy fellow-servant, as I too had pity on thee? ",selected_bible_verses
559,"And his lord was angry, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due to him. ",selected_bible_verses
560,"So also will my heavenly Father do to you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother.    XIX.  AND it came to pass, when Jesus finished these sayings, that he departed from Galilee, and came into the borders of Judaea beyond the Jordan. ",selected_bible_verses
561,"And great multitudes followed him, and he healed them there.  ",selected_bible_verses
562,"And the Pharisees came to him, tempting him and saying: Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?  ",selected_bible_verses
563,"and said: For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh. ",selected_bible_verses
564,"So that they are no longer two, but one flesh. What therefore God joined together, let not man put asunder.  ",selected_bible_verses
565,"They say to him: Why then did Moses command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away? ",selected_bible_verses
566,"He says to them: Moses, for your hardness of heart, suffered you to put away your wives; but from the beginning it was not so. ",selected_bible_verses
567,"And I say to you, that whoever shall put away his wife, except for fornication, and shall marry another, commits adultery; and whoever marries her when put away, commits adultery.  ",selected_bible_verses
568,"His disciples say to him: If the case of the man with the woman is so, it is not good to marry. ",selected_bible_verses
569,"But he said to them: Not all can receive this saying, but they to whom it is given. ",selected_bible_verses
570,"For there are eunuchs, who were so born from the mother's womb; and there are eunuchs, who were made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs, who made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.  ",selected_bible_verses
571,"Then were brought to him little children, that he might put his hands on them and pray; and the disciples rebuked them. ",selected_bible_verses
572,"But Jesus said: Suffer the little children, and forbid them not to come to me; for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven. ",selected_bible_verses
573,"And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.  ",selected_bible_verses
574,"And, behold, one came to him and said: Teacher, what good shall I do, that I may have eternal life? ",selected_bible_verses
575,"And, he said to him: Why dost thou ask me concerning good? One is the Good. But if thou desirest to enter into life, keep the commandments. ",selected_bible_verses
576,"He says to him, Which? Jesus said: Thou shalt not kill; Thou shalt not commit adultery; Thou shalt not steal; Thou shalt not bear false witness; ",selected_bible_verses
577,"Honor thy father and thy mother; and, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. ",selected_bible_verses
578,The young man says to him: All these I kept; what do I yet lack? ,selected_bible_verses
579,"Jesus said to him: If thou desirest to be perfect, go, sell what thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me. ",selected_bible_verses
580,"But when the young man heard this saying, he went away sorrowful; for he had great possessions.  ",selected_bible_verses
581,"And Jesus said to his disciples: Verily I say to you, that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven. ",selected_bible_verses
582,"And again I say to you: It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. ",selected_bible_verses
583,"And the disciples, hearing it, were exceedingly amazed, saying: Who then can be saved? ",selected_bible_verses
584,"But Jesus, looking on them, said to them: With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible. ",selected_bible_verses
585,"Then Peter answering said to him: Behold, we forsook all, and followed thee; what then shall we have? ",selected_bible_verses
586,"And Jesus said to them: Verily I say to you, that ye who followed me, in the renovation, when the Son of man shall sit on his throne of glory, shall also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. ",selected_bible_verses
587,"And every one who forsook houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive manifold more, and shall inherit everlasting life. ",selected_bible_verses
588,"But many first will be last, and last first.    XX.  FOR the kingdom of heaven is like to a householder, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers into his vineyard. ",selected_bible_verses
589,"And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the market-place. ",selected_bible_verses
590,"And to them he said: Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you. And they went their way.  ",selected_bible_verses
591,"Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise.  ",selected_bible_verses
592,"And about the eleventh he went out, and found others standing, and says to them: Why stand ye here all the day idle? ",selected_bible_verses
593,They say to him: Because no one hired us. He says to them: Go ye also into the vineyard.  ,selected_bible_verses
594,"And when evening was come, the lord of the vineyard says to his steward: Call the laborers, and pay them the hire, beginning from the last, unto the first. ",selected_bible_verses
595,"And they of the eleventh hour came, and received every man a denary. ",selected_bible_verses
596,"But when the first came, they supposed that they should receive more; and they also received each one a denary. ",selected_bible_verses
597,"And on receiving it, they murmured against the householder, ",selected_bible_verses
598,"saying: These last labored one hour, and thou madest them equal to us, who bore the burden of the day, and the burning heat.  ",selected_bible_verses
599,"But he answering said to one of them: Friend, I do thee no wrong. Didst thou not agree with me for a denary? ",selected_bible_verses
600,"Take what is thine, and go. But I will give to this last, even as to thee. ",selected_bible_verses
601,"Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with my own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?  ",selected_bible_verses
602,"So will the last be first, and the first last; for many are called, but few are chosen.  ",selected_bible_verses
603,"And Jesus, going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples apart; and in the way he said to them: ",selected_bible_verses
604,"Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death, ",selected_bible_verses
605,and will deliver him to the Gentiles to mock and scourge and crucify; and on the third day he will rise again.  ,selected_bible_verses
606,"Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee, with her sons, bowing down and asking a certain thing of him. ",selected_bible_verses
607,"And he said to her: What wilt thou? She says to him: Command that these my two sons shall sit, one on thy right hand, and one on thy left, in thy kingdom. ",selected_bible_verses
608,But Jesus answering said: Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of? They say to him: We are able. ,selected_bible_verses
609,"And he says to them: Ye shall drink indeed of my cup; but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but is for them for whom it has been prepared by my Father. ",selected_bible_verses
610,"And the ten, hearing it, were much displeased with the two brothers. ",selected_bible_verses
611,"But Jesus, having called them to him, said: Ye know that the rulers of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and they that are great exercise authority over them. ",selected_bible_verses
612,Not so shall it be among you; ,selected_bible_verses
613,"but whoever would become great among you, let him be your minister; and whoever would be first among you, let him be your servant; ",selected_bible_verses
614,"even as the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.  ",selected_bible_verses
615,"And as they were going forth from Jericho, a great multitude followed him. ",selected_bible_verses
616,"And behold, two blind men sitting by the way-side, hearing that Jesus was passing by, cried, saying: Have mercy on us, O Lord, Son of David. ",selected_bible_verses
617,"And the multitude rebuked them, that they should hold their peace. But they cried the more, saying: Have mercy on us, O Lord, Son of David. ",selected_bible_verses
618,"And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said: What will ye that I shall do to you? ",selected_bible_verses
619,"They say to him: Lord, that our eyes may be opened. ",selected_bible_verses
620,"And Jesus, moved with compassion, touched their eyes; and immediately their eyes received sight; and they followed him.    XXI.  AND when they drew near to Jerusalem, and came to Bethphage, at the mount of the Olives, Jesus sent forth two disciples, ",selected_bible_verses
621,"saying to them: Go into the village over against you, and straightway ye will find an ass tied, and a colt with her; loose and bring them to me. ",selected_bible_verses
622,"And if any one say aught to you, ye shall say: The Lord has need of them; and straightway he will send them.  ",selected_bible_verses
623,"Now all this has been done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying:      ",selected_bible_verses
624,"Say to the daughter of Zion,     Behold, thy King comes to thee,     Meek, and mounted upon an ass,     And upon a colt, the foal of a beast of burden.  ",selected_bible_verses
625,"And the disciples, having gone and done as Jesus commanded them, ",selected_bible_verses
626,"brought the ass and the colt, and put on them their garments, and he sat thereon. ",selected_bible_verses
627,"And most of the multitude spread their own garments in the way; and others cut down branches from the trees, and strewed in the way. ",selected_bible_verses
628,"And as he entered into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying: Who is this? ",selected_bible_verses
629,"And the multitudes said: This is Jesus the prophet, from Nazareth of Galilee.  ",selected_bible_verses
630,"And Jesus entered into the temple of God, and cast out all that sold and bought in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of those who sold doves. ",selected_bible_verses
631,"And he says to them: It is written,      My house shall be called a house of prayer;     But ye make it a den of robbers.  ",selected_bible_verses
632,"And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them. ",selected_bible_verses
633,"But the chief priests and the scribes, seeing the wonders that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David, were much displeased, ",selected_bible_verses
634,and said to him: Dost thou hear what these say? And Jesus says to them: Yea; did ye never read: From the mouth of babes and sucklings thou preparedst praise?  ,selected_bible_verses
635,"And leaving them, he went forth out of the city into Bethany, and lodged there.  ",selected_bible_verses
636,"And in the morning, as he was returning into the city, he hungered. ",selected_bible_verses
637,"And seeing a fig-tree by the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon but leaves only. And he says to it: Let there be no fruit from thee henceforward, forever. And immediately the fig-tree withered away. ",selected_bible_verses
638,"And the disciples seeing it wondered, saying: How did the fig-tree immediately wither away? ",selected_bible_verses
639,"And Jesus answering said to them: Verily I say to you, if ye have faith, and do not doubt, not only shall ye do what is done to the fig-tree, but even if ye say to this mountain, be thou taken up and cast into the sea, it shall be done. ",selected_bible_verses
640,"And all things whatever ye ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.  ",selected_bible_verses
641,"And when he had come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said: By what authority doest thou these things; and who gave thee this authority? ",selected_bible_verses
642,"And Jesus answering said to them: I also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I too will tell you by what authority I do these things. ",selected_bible_verses
643,"John's immersion, whence was it? From heaven, or from men? And they reasoned among themselves, saying: If we say, From heaven, he will say to us: Why then did ye not believe him? ",selected_bible_verses
644,"But if we say, From men, we fear the multitude; for all hold John as a prophet. ",selected_bible_verses
645,"And they answered Jesus, saying: We do not know. And he said to them: Neither do I say to you, by what authority I do these things.  ",selected_bible_verses
646,"But what think ye? A man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said: Son, go work to-day in the vineyard. ",selected_bible_verses
647,"And he answering said: I will not; but afterward he repented, and went. ",selected_bible_verses
648,"For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and ye did not believe him; but the publicans and the harlots believed him; and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him.  ",selected_bible_verses
649,"Hear another parable. There was a householder, who planted a vineyard, and put a hedge around it, and dug a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husband-men, and went abroad. ",selected_bible_verses
650,"And when the season of fruits drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, to receive his fruits. ",selected_bible_verses
651,"And the husbandmen taking his servants, beat one, and killed another, and stoned another. ",selected_bible_verses
652,"Again he sent other servants, more than the first; and they did to them likewise. ",selected_bible_verses
653,"And afterward he sent to them his son, saying: They will reverence my son. ",selected_bible_verses
654,"But the husbandmen, seeing the son, said among themselves: This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and have his inheritance. ",selected_bible_verses
655,"And taking him, they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. ",selected_bible_verses
656,"When therefore the lord of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those husbandmen? ",selected_bible_verses
657,"They say to him: He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out the vineyard to other husbandmen, who will deliver over to him the fruits in their seasons. ",selected_bible_verses
658,"Jesus says to them: Did ye never read in the Scriptures:      The stone which the builders disallowed,     The same is become the head of the corner;     This is from the Lord,     And is wonderful in our eyes.  ",selected_bible_verses
659,"Therefore I say to you, that the kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof. ",selected_bible_verses
660,"And he that falls upon this stone will be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.  ",selected_bible_verses
661,"And the chief priests and Pharisees, hearing his parables, knew that he spoke of them. ",selected_bible_verses
662,"And they sought to lay hold of him, but feared the multitudes, since they held him as a prophet.    XXII.  AND Jesus answering spoke to them again in parables, saying:  ",selected_bible_verses
663,"The kingdom of heaven is like to a certain king, who made a marriage for his son. ",selected_bible_verses
664,And he sent forth his servants to call those who were bidden to the wedding; and they would not come. ,selected_bible_verses
665,"Again he sent forth other servants, saying: Tell those who are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready; come to the marriage. ",selected_bible_verses
666,"But they made light of it, and went away, one to his farm, another to his merchandise. ",selected_bible_verses
667,"And the rest laid hold of his servants, and ill-treated and slew them. ",selected_bible_verses
668,"And the king, hearing it, was angry; and sending forth his armies, he destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city. ",selected_bible_verses
669,"Then he says to his servants: The wedding is ready, but they who were bidden were not worthy. ",selected_bible_verses
670,"Go therefore into the thoroughfares, and as many as ye find, bid to the marriage. ",selected_bible_verses
671,"And those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good; and the wedding was furnished with guests.  ",selected_bible_verses
672,"And the king, coming in to view the guests, saw there a man not clothed with a wedding garment; ",selected_bible_verses
673,"and he says to him: Friend, how camest thou in hither, not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless. ",selected_bible_verses
674,"Then the king said to the attendants: Bind him hand and foot, and cast him forth into the outer darkness. There will be the weeping, and the gnashing of teeth! ",selected_bible_verses
675,"For many are called, but few are chosen.  ",selected_bible_verses
676,"And they send out to him their disciples, with the Herodians, saying: Teacher, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth; neither carest thou for any one, for thou regardest not the person of men. ",selected_bible_verses
677,"Tell us, therefore, what thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not? ",selected_bible_verses
678,"But Jesus, knowing their wickedness, said: Why tempt ye me, hypocrites! ",selected_bible_verses
679,"And he says to them: Whose is this image, and the inscription? ",selected_bible_verses
680,"They say to him: Caesar's. Then says he to them; Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. ",selected_bible_verses
681,"And hearing it they wondered, and left him and went away.  ",selected_bible_verses
682,"On that day came to him Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection, and asked him, ",selected_bible_verses
683,"saying: Teacher, Moses said, If any one die having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed to his brother. ",selected_bible_verses
684,"Now there were with us seven brothers; and the first married and died, and having no seed left his wife to his brother. ",selected_bible_verses
685,"Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh. ",selected_bible_verses
686,And last of all the woman died also. ,selected_bible_verses
687,"In the resurrection therefore, of which of the seven shall she be wife? For they all had her.  ",selected_bible_verses
688,"Jesus answering said to them: Ye err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God. ",selected_bible_verses
689,"For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven. ",selected_bible_verses
690,"But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying: ",selected_bible_verses
691,"I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living. ",selected_bible_verses
692,"And the multitudes, hearing it, were astonished at his teaching.  ",selected_bible_verses
693,"And the Pharisees, hearing that he had put the Sadducees to silence, collected together; ",selected_bible_verses
694,"and one of them, a lawyer, asked, tempting him and saying: ",selected_bible_verses
695,"Teacher, what commandment is great in the law? ",selected_bible_verses
696,"Jesus said to him: Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. ",selected_bible_verses
697,This is the great and first commandment. ,selected_bible_verses
698,And the second is like to it: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thy self. ,selected_bible_verses
699,On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.  ,selected_bible_verses
700,"While the Pharisees were collected together, Jesus asked them, ",selected_bible_verses
701,saying: What think ye concerning the Christ? Of whom is he the son? They say to him: Of David. ,selected_bible_verses
702,"He says to them: How then does David, in the Spirit, call him Lord, saying:      ",selected_bible_verses
703,"The Lord said to my Lord,     Sit on my right hand,     Till I put thine enemies under thy feet.  ",selected_bible_verses
704,"If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son? ",selected_bible_verses
705,"And no one was able to answer him a word; nor durst any one from that day question him any more.    XXIII.  THEN Jesus spoke to the multitudes, and to his disciples, ",selected_bible_verses
706,saying: The scribes and the Pharisees sat down in Moses' seat. ,selected_bible_verses
707,"All, therefore, whatever they bid you, do and observe; but do not according to their works, for they say and do not. ",selected_bible_verses
708,"For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders, but will not move them with their finger. ",selected_bible_verses
709,"But all their works they do to be seen by men; they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the fringes; ",selected_bible_verses
710,"and love the first place at feasts, and the first seats in the synagogues, ",selected_bible_verses
711,"But be not ye called Rabbi; for one is your Teacher, and all ye are brethren. ",selected_bible_verses
712,"And call not any your father on the earth; for one is your Father, he who is in heaven. ",selected_bible_verses
713,"Neither be called leaders; for one is your leader, the Christ. ",selected_bible_verses
714,But the greatest of you shall be your servant. ,selected_bible_verses
715,And whoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.  ,selected_bible_verses
716,"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye traverse sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more a child of hell than yourselves.  ",selected_bible_verses
717,"Woe to you, blind guides, who say: Whoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is bound. ",selected_bible_verses
718,"Fools and blind; for which is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifies the gold? ",selected_bible_verses
719,"And, Whoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever shall swear by the gift that is upon it, he is bound. ",selected_bible_verses
720,"Fools and blind; for which is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifies the gift?  ",selected_bible_verses
721,"He therefore who swears by the altar, swears by it, and by all things thereon. ",selected_bible_verses
722,"And he that swears by the temple, swears by it, and by him who dwells therein. ",selected_bible_verses
723,"And he that swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God, and by him who sits thereon.  ",selected_bible_verses
724,"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye pay tithe of the mint and the dill and the cumin, and omitted the weightier things of the law, judgment, and mercy, and faith; these ought ye to have done, and not leave those undone.  ",selected_bible_verses
725,"Blind guides! that strain out the gnat, and swallow the camel.  ",selected_bible_verses
726,"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye cleanse the outside of the cup and the platter, but within they are full of rapacity and excess. ",selected_bible_verses
727,"Blind Pharisee! Cleanse first the inside of the cup and the platter, that its outside also may become clean.  ",selected_bible_verses
728,"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye are like to whited sepulchres, which outwardly indeed appear beautiful, but within are full of bones of the dead, and of all uncleanness. ",selected_bible_verses
729,"So also ye outwardly indeed appear righteous to men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.  ",selected_bible_verses
730,"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and adorn the tombs of the righteous, and say: ",selected_bible_verses
731,"If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets. ",selected_bible_verses
732,"So that ye witness to yourselves, that ye are sons of those who killed the prophets; ",selected_bible_verses
733,and fill ye up the measure of your fathers!  ,selected_bible_verses
734,Serpents! Brood of vipers! How can ye escape the judgment of hell?  ,selected_bible_verses
735,"Therefore, behold, I send forth to you prophets, and wise men, and scribes; and some of them ye will kill and crucify, and some of them ye will scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from city to city; ",selected_bible_verses
736,"that on you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, son of Barachiah, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar. ",selected_bible_verses
737,"Verily I say to you, all these things shall come upon this generation.  ",selected_bible_verses
738,"Jerusalem! Jerusalem! that killest the prophets, and stonest those sent to her; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, and ye would not! ",selected_bible_verses
739,"Behold, your house is left to you desolate. ",selected_bible_verses
740,"For I say to you, ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say: Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord.    XXIV.  AND Jesus went out, and departed from the temple; and his disciples came to him, to show him the buildings of the temple. ",selected_bible_verses
741,"And he answering said to them: See ye not all these things? Verily I say to you, there shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.  ",selected_bible_verses
742,"And as he sat on the mount of the Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying: Tell us, when will these things be, and what is the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world? ",selected_bible_verses
743,"And Jesus answering said to them: Take heed, lest any one lead you astray. ",selected_bible_verses
744,"For many will come in my name, saying: I am the Christ; and will lead astray many. ",selected_bible_verses
745,"For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. ",selected_bible_verses
746,But all these are the beginning of sorrows. ,selected_bible_verses
747,"Then will they deliver you up unto affliction, and will kill you; and ye will be hated by all nations for my name's sake. ",selected_bible_verses
748,"And then will many be offended, and will deliver up one another, and will hate one another. ",selected_bible_verses
749,"And many false prophets will arise, and will lead many astray. ",selected_bible_verses
750,"And because iniquity abounds, the love of the many will become cold. ",selected_bible_verses
751,"But he that has endured to the end, the same shall be saved. ",selected_bible_verses
752,"And this good news of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world, for a testimony to all nations; and then shall come the end.  ",selected_bible_verses
753,"When therefore ye see the abomination of desolation, spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let him that reads mark!) ",selected_bible_verses
754,"then let those in Judaea flee to the mountains; he that is upon the house, ",selected_bible_verses
755,let him not come down to take the things out of his house; ,selected_bible_verses
756,"and he that is in the field, let him not turn back to take his garments. ",selected_bible_verses
757,"But woe to those who are with child, and to those who give suck in those days! ",selected_bible_verses
758,"And pray that your flight be not in winter, nor on a sabbath. ",selected_bible_verses
759,"For then will be great affliction, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no nor shall be. ",selected_bible_verses
760,"And unless those days were shortened, no flesh would be saved; but for the sake of the chosen, those days shall be shortened. ",selected_bible_verses
761,"Then if any one say to you: Lo, here is the Christ, or, Here, believe it not. ",selected_bible_verses
762,"For there will arise false Christs, and false prophets, and will show great signs and wonders; so as, if possible, to lead even the chosen astray. ",selected_bible_verses
763,"Behold, I have told you before.  ",selected_bible_verses
764,"If therefore they say to you: Behold, he is in the desert, go not forth; Behold, he is in the secret chambers, believe it not. ",selected_bible_verses
765,"For as the lightning comes forth from the east, and shines even unto the west, so shall be the coming of the Son of man. ",selected_bible_verses
766,"For wherever the carcass is, there will the eagles be gathered together.  ",selected_bible_verses
767,"And immediately, after the affliction of those days, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of heaven shall be shaken. ",selected_bible_verses
768,"And he will send forth his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his chosen from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.  ",selected_bible_verses
769,"And learn the parable from the fig-tree: When its branch is already become tender, and puts forth leaves, ye know that the summer is near. ",selected_bible_verses
770,"So also ye, when ye see all these things, know that it is near, at the doors.  ",selected_bible_verses
771,"Verily I say to you, this generation shall not pass, till all these things are done. ",selected_bible_verses
772,Heaven and earth shall pass away; but my words shall not pass away.  ,selected_bible_verses
773,"But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, but my Father only. ",selected_bible_verses
774,"But as the days of Noah, so shall be also the coming of the Son of man. ",selected_bible_verses
775,"For as they were in the days before the flood, eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, ",selected_bible_verses
776,"and knew not until the flood came, and took all away; so shall be also the coming of the Son of man. ",selected_bible_verses
777,"Then shall there be two men in the field, one is taken, and one is left; ",selected_bible_verses
778,"two women grinding at the mill, one is taken, and one is left.  ",selected_bible_verses
779,"But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken through. ",selected_bible_verses
780,"Therefore be ye also ready; for in such an hour as ye think not, the Son of man comes.  ",selected_bible_verses
781,"Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his lord set over his household, to give them their food in due season? ",selected_bible_verses
782,"Happy that servant, whom his lord when he comes shall find so doing! ",selected_bible_verses
783,"Verily I say to you, that he will set him over all his goods. ",selected_bible_verses
784,But if that evil servant shall say in his heart: My lord delays his coming; ,selected_bible_verses
785,"and shall begin to beat his fellow-servants, and shall eat and drink with the drunken; ",selected_bible_verses
786,"the lord of that servant will come in a day when he looks not for it, and in an hour when he is not aware; ",selected_bible_verses
787,"and will cut him asunder, and appoint his portion with the hypocrites. There will be the weeping, and the gnashing of teeth!    XXV.  THEN shall the kingdom of heaven be likened to ten virgins, who took their lamps, and went out to meet the bridegroom. ",selected_bible_verses
788,"And five of them were wise, and five foolish. ",selected_bible_verses
789,"The foolish, taking their lamps, took no oil with them; ",selected_bible_verses
790,but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. ,selected_bible_verses
791,"While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. ",selected_bible_verses
792,"And at midnight a cry was made: Behold, the bridegroom! Go out to meet him. ",selected_bible_verses
793,"Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. ",selected_bible_verses
794,"And the foolish said to the wise: Give us of your oil, for our lamps are going out. ",selected_bible_verses
795,"But the wise answered, saying: Not so; there will not be enough for us and you. Go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves. ",selected_bible_verses
796,"And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they who were ready went in with him to the marriage; and the door was shut. ",selected_bible_verses
797,"And afterward come also the rest of the virgins, saying: Lord, Lord, open to us. ",selected_bible_verses
798,"But he answering said: Verily I say to you, I know you not.  ",selected_bible_verses
799,"Watch, therefore; because ye know not the day, nor the hour!  ",selected_bible_verses
800,"For as a man going abroad called his own servants, and delivered to them his goods; ",selected_bible_verses
801,"and to one gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, to each according to his own ability; and straightway went abroad. ",selected_bible_verses
802,"And he that received the five talents went and traded with them, and gained other five talents. ",selected_bible_verses
803,Likewise also he that received the two gained other two. ,selected_bible_verses
804,"But he that received the one went away and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money. ",selected_bible_verses
805,"After a long time the lord of those servants comes, and reckons with them. ",selected_bible_verses
806,"And he that received the five talents came and brought other five talents, saying: Lord, thou deliveredst to me five talents; behold, I gained other five talents beside them. ",selected_bible_verses
807,"His lord said to him: Well done, good and faithful servant; thou wast faithful over a little, I will set thee over much. Enter thou into the joy of thy lord. ",selected_bible_verses
808,"And he also that received the two talents came and said: Lord, thou deliveredst to me two talents; behold, I gained other two talents beside them. ",selected_bible_verses
809,"His lord said to him: Well done, good and faithful servant; thou wast faithful over a little, I will set thee over much. Enter thou into the joy of thy lord. ",selected_bible_verses
810,"And he also that received the one talent came and said: Lord, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou didst not sow, and gathering where thou strewedst not. ",selected_bible_verses
811,"And fearing, I went and hid thy talent in the earth. Lo, thou hast thine own. ",selected_bible_verses
812,"And his lord answering said to him: Wicked and slothful servant! Thou knewest that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I strewed not? ",selected_bible_verses
813,"Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers; and when I came, I should have received my own with interest. ",selected_bible_verses
814,"Take therefore the talent from him, and give to him that has the ten talents. ",selected_bible_verses
815,"For to every one that has shall be given, and he shall have abundance; but from him that has not, even what he has shall be taken away. ",selected_bible_verses
816,"And cast forth the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness. There will be the weeping, and the gnashing of teeth!  ",selected_bible_verses
817,"And when the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the angels with him, then will he sit on his throne of glory. ",selected_bible_verses
818,"And before him shall be gathered all the nations; and he will divide them one from another, as the shepherd divides the sheep from the goats. ",selected_bible_verses
819,"And he will set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.  ",selected_bible_verses
820,"Then will the King say to those on his right hand: Come, blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. ",selected_bible_verses
821,"For I was hungry, and ye gave me to eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger and ye took me in, ",selected_bible_verses
822,"naked and ye clothed me; I was sick, and ye visited me; I was in prison, and ye came to me.  ",selected_bible_verses
823,"Then will the righteous answer him, saying: Lord, when saw we thee hungering and fed thee, or thirsting and gave thee drink? ",selected_bible_verses
824,"And when saw we thee a stranger and took thee in, or naked and clothed thee? ",selected_bible_verses
825,"And when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came to thee? ",selected_bible_verses
826,"And the King will answer and say to them: Verily I say to you, inasmuch as ye did it to one of the least of these my brethren, ye did it to me.  ",selected_bible_verses
827,"Then will he say also to those on the left hand: Depart from me, accursed, into the everlasting fire; prepared for the Devil and his angels. ",selected_bible_verses
828,"For I was hungry, and ye did not give me to eat; I was thirsty, and ye did not give me drink; ",selected_bible_verses
829,"I was a stranger, and ye did not take me in; naked, and ye did not clothe me; sick, and in prison, and ye did not visit me.  ",selected_bible_verses
830,"Then will they also answer, saying: Lord, when saw we thee hungering, or thirsting, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to thee? ",selected_bible_verses
831,"Then will he answer them, saying: Verily I say to you, inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.  ",selected_bible_verses
832,"And these shall go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into everlasting life.    XXVI.  AND it came to pass, when Jesus finished all these sayings, he said to his disciples: ",selected_bible_verses
833,"Ye know that after two days comes the passover, and the Son of man is delivered up to be crucified.  ",selected_bible_verses
834,"Then assembled together the chief priests, and the elders of the people, in the court of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas, ",selected_bible_verses
835,"and consulted together that they might take Jesus by craft, and put him to death. ",selected_bible_verses
836,"But they said: Not at the feast, that there may not be a tumult among the people.  ",selected_bible_verses
837,"And Jesus being in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, ",selected_bible_verses
838,"there came to him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head as he reclined at table. ",selected_bible_verses
839,"And his disciples seeing it were displeased, saying: To what purpose is this waste? ",selected_bible_verses
840,"For this might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. ",selected_bible_verses
841,"And Jesus knowing it, said to them: Why trouble ye the woman? For she wrought a good work upon me. ",selected_bible_verses
842,For the poor ye have always with you; but me ye have not always. ,selected_bible_verses
843,"For she, in pouring this ointment on my body, did it to prepare me for burial. ",selected_bible_verses
844,"Verily I say to you, wherever this good news shall be preached in the whole world, this also that she did shall be told, for a memorial of her.  ",selected_bible_verses
845,"Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests, ",selected_bible_verses
846,"and said: What will ye give me, and I will deliver him to you? And they weighed out to him thirty pieces of silver. ",selected_bible_verses
847,And from that time he sought opportunity to deliver him up.  ,selected_bible_verses
848,"And on the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying to him: Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover? ",selected_bible_verses
849,"And he said: Go into the city to such a man, and say to him: The Teacher says, my time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples. ",selected_bible_verses
850,"And the disciples did as Jesus directed them, and made ready the passover.  ",selected_bible_verses
851,"And when evening was come, he reclined at table with the twelve. ",selected_bible_verses
852,"And as they were eating, he said: Verily I say to you, that one of you will betray me. ",selected_bible_verses
853,"And they were exceedingly sorrowful, and began to say to him, each one: Lord, is it I? ",selected_bible_verses
854,"And he answering said: He that dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same will betray me. ",selected_bible_verses
855,"The Son of man goes indeed, as it is written of him; but woe to that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! It were good for him, if that man had not been born.  ",selected_bible_verses
856,"And Judas, his betrayer, answering said: Rabbi, is it I? He says to him: Thou saidst it.  ",selected_bible_verses
857,"And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave to them, saying: Drink all ye of it. ",selected_bible_verses
858,"And I say to you, that I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you, in the kingdom of my Father.  ",selected_bible_verses
859,"And having sung, they went out into the mount of the Olives.  ",selected_bible_verses
860,"Then Jesus says to them: All ye will be offended because of me this night. For it is written: I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad. ",selected_bible_verses
861,"But after I have risen, I will go before you into Galilee.  ",selected_bible_verses
862,"Peter answering said to him: Though all shall be offended because of thee, I will never be offended. ",selected_bible_verses
863,"Jesus said to him: Verily I say to thee, that this night, before a cock crows, thou wilt thrice deny me. ",selected_bible_verses
864,"Peter says to him: Even though I should die with thee, I will not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.  ",selected_bible_verses
865,"Then Jesus comes with them to a place called Gethsemane, and says to the disciples: Sit ye here, while I go yonder and pray. ",selected_bible_verses
866,"And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful, and to be troubled. ",selected_bible_verses
867,"Then says he to them: My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, unto death. Tarry ye here, and watch with me.  ",selected_bible_verses
868,"And going forward a little, he fell on his face, praying, and saying: My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me. But yet, not as I will, but as thou wilt. ",selected_bible_verses
869,"And he comes to the disciples, and finds them sleeping; and he says to Peter: Were ye so unable to watch with me one hour? ",selected_bible_verses
870,"Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.  ",selected_bible_verses
871,"Again, a second time, he went away and prayed, saying: My Father, if this can not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done. ",selected_bible_verses
872,And coming he again found them sleeping; for their eyes were heavy.  ,selected_bible_verses
873,"And leaving them, he went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words. ",selected_bible_verses
874,"Rise, let us be going. Behold, he is at hand that betrays me.  ",selected_bible_verses
875,"And while he was yet speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people. ",selected_bible_verses
876,"And his betrayer gave them a sign, saying: Whom I shall kiss, that is he; hold him fast. ",selected_bible_verses
877,"And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said: Hail, Rabbi; and kissed him. ",selected_bible_verses
878,"And Jesus said to him: Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then they came, and laid hands on Jesus, and held him fast. ",selected_bible_verses
879,"And, behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and striking the servant of the high priest took off his ear. ",selected_bible_verses
880,Then says Jesus to him: Put back thy sword into its place; for all they who take the sword shall perish with the sword. ,selected_bible_verses
881,"How then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?  ",selected_bible_verses
882,"In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes: Are ye come out as against a robber, with swords and staves, to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye did not lay hold of me. ",selected_bible_verses
883,"But all this has been done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then the disciples all forsook him, and fled.  ",selected_bible_verses
884,"And they who laid hold of Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled. ",selected_bible_verses
885,"And Peter followed him afar off, unto the court of the high priest; and entering in, he sat with the servants, to see the end.  ",selected_bible_verses
886,"And the chief priests, and the elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, that they might put him to death; ",selected_bible_verses
887,"and found none, though many false witnesses came. But at last came two, ",selected_bible_verses
888,"and said: This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days. ",selected_bible_verses
889,"And the high priest arose, and said to him: Answerest thou nothing? What do these witness against thee? ",selected_bible_verses
890,"But Jesus was silent. And the high priest answering said to him: I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou art the Christ, the Son of God. ",selected_bible_verses
891,"Jesus says to him: Thou saidst it. But I say to you, hereafter ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming on the clouds of heaven. ",selected_bible_verses
892,"Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying: He blasphemed! What further need have we of witnesses? Behold, ye now heard his blasphemy. ",selected_bible_verses
893,What think ye? They answering said: He is guilty of death. ,selected_bible_verses
894,"Then they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him, ",selected_bible_verses
895,"saying: Prophesy to us, O Christ, who is he that struck thee?  ",selected_bible_verses
896,"And Peter was sitting without, in the court. And a damsel came to him, saying: Thou also wast with Jesus the Galilaean. ",selected_bible_verses
897,"But he denied before all, saying: I know not what thou sayest. ",selected_bible_verses
898,"And he having gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said to those who were there: This man also was with Jesus the Nazarene. ",selected_bible_verses
899,"And again he denied, with an oath: I do not know the man. ",selected_bible_verses
900,"And after a little while, they that stood by came and said to Peter: Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech betrays thee. ",selected_bible_verses
901,"Then he began to invoke curses, and to swear: I do not know the man. And immediately a cock crowed. ",selected_bible_verses
902,"And Peter remembered the word of Jesus when he said: Before a cock crows, thou wilt thrice deny me. And he went out, and wept bitterly.    XXVII.  AND when morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus, so as to put him to death. ",selected_bible_verses
903,"And having bound him, they led him away, and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate the governor.  ",selected_bible_verses
904,"Then Judas, who betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repenting brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders, ",selected_bible_verses
905,saying: I sinned in betraying innocent blood. And they said: What is it to us? Look thou to it. ,selected_bible_verses
906,"And casting down the pieces of silver in the temple, he departed; and he went away and hanged himself. ",selected_bible_verses
907,"And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said: It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood. ",selected_bible_verses
908,"And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in. ",selected_bible_verses
909,"Wherefore that field was called the field of blood, unto this day.  ",selected_bible_verses
910,"Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying:      And they took the thirty pieces of silver,     The price of him that was priced,     Whom they of the sons of Israel did price,     ",selected_bible_verses
911,"And gave them for the potter's field,           as the Lord appointed to me.  ",selected_bible_verses
912,"And Jesus stood before the governor. And the governor questioned him, saying: Art thou the king of the Jews? And Jesus said to him: Thou sayest it. ",selected_bible_verses
913,"And when he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he made no answer. ",selected_bible_verses
914,Then says Pilate to him: Hearest thou not what things they witness against thee? ,selected_bible_verses
915,"And he made him no answer, not even to one word; so that the governor greatly wondered.  ",selected_bible_verses
916,"Now at the feast the governor was wont to release to the multitude one prisoner, whom they would. ",selected_bible_verses
917,"And they had then a noted prisoner, called Barabbas. ",selected_bible_verses
918,"When therefore they were assembled, Pilate said to them: Whom will ye that I release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ? ",selected_bible_verses
919,For he knew that through envy they delivered him up.  ,selected_bible_verses
920,"And as he sat on the judgment-seat, his wife sent to him, saying: Have nothing to do with that just man; for I suffered much this day, in a dream, because of him.  ",selected_bible_verses
921,"And the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes, that they should ask for Barabbas, and should destroy Jesus. ",selected_bible_verses
922,And the governor answering said to them: Which of the two will ye that I release to you? And they said: Barabbas. ,selected_bible_verses
923,"Pilate says to them: What then shall I do with Jesus, who is called Christ? They all say to him: Let him be crucified. ",selected_bible_verses
924,"And the governor said: What evil then did he? But they cried the more, saying: Let him be crucified.  ",selected_bible_verses
925,"And Pilate, seeing that it avails nothing, but rather that a tumult is made, took water and washed his hands before the multitude, saying: I am innocent of the blood of this just man. Look ye to it. ",selected_bible_verses
926,"And all the people answering said: His blood be on us, and on our children. ",selected_bible_verses
927,"Then he released to them Barabbas; but Jesus, having scourged him, he delivered up to be crucified.  ",selected_bible_verses
928,"Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Pretorium, and gathered to him the whole band. ",selected_bible_verses
929,"And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe. ",selected_bible_verses
930,"And having platted a crown of thorns, they put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand; and bowing the knee before him, they mocked him, saying: Hail, King of the Jews! ",selected_bible_verses
931,"And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head. ",selected_bible_verses
932,"And when they had mocked him, they took off the robe from him, and put on him his own garments, and led him away to crucify him. ",selected_bible_verses
933,"And as they came out they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name; him they compelled to bear his cross.  ",selected_bible_verses
934,"And having come to a place called Golgotha (which is called, Place of a skull), ",selected_bible_verses
935,"And having crucified him, they divided his garments among them, casting lots. ",selected_bible_verses
936,"And sitting down, they watched him there. ",selected_bible_verses
937,"And they set up over his head his accusation, written: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.  ",selected_bible_verses
938,"Two robbers are then crucified with him, one on the right hand, and one on the left. ",selected_bible_verses
939,"And those passing by reviled him, wagging their heads, ",selected_bible_verses
940,"and saying: Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou art the Son of God, come down from the cross. ",selected_bible_verses
941,"Likewise also the chief priests mocking, with the scribes and elders, said: ",selected_bible_verses
942,"Others he saved, himself he can not save. If he is King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe on him. ",selected_bible_verses
943,"He trusts in God; let him now deliver him, if he desires him; for he said I am the Son of God. ",selected_bible_verses
944,"And also the robbers, who were crucified with him, reproached him with the same thing.  ",selected_bible_verses
945,"And from the sixth hour, there was darkness over all the land, unto the ninth hour. ",selected_bible_verses
946,"And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying: Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani? That is: My God, my God, why didst thou forsake me? ",selected_bible_verses
947,"And straightway one of them ran and took a sponge, and having filled it with vinegar and put it on a reed, gave him to drink. ",selected_bible_verses
948,But the rest said: Let alone; let us see whether Elijah comes to save him.  ,selected_bible_verses
949,"And Jesus, again crying with a loud voice, yielded up his spirit. ",selected_bible_verses
950,"And behold, the vail of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth quaked, and the rocks were rent; ",selected_bible_verses
951,"and the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who have fallen asleep arose, ",selected_bible_verses
952,"and coming out of the tombs, after his resurrection, went into the holy city, and appeared to many.  ",selected_bible_verses
953,"And the centurion, and they that with him were watching Jesus, on seeing the earthquake, and the things that were done, were exceedingly afraid, saying: Truly this was the Son of God.  ",selected_bible_verses
954,"And many women were there, beholding afar off, they who followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him; ",selected_bible_verses
955,"among whom was Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.  ",selected_bible_verses
956,"And evening having come, there came a rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was a disciple of Jesus. ",selected_bible_verses
957,"This man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded that the body should be given up. ",selected_bible_verses
958,"And taking the body, Joseph wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, ",selected_bible_verses
959,"and laid it in his own new tomb, which he hewed out in the rock. And having rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, he departed. ",selected_bible_verses
960,"And Mary the Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.  ",selected_bible_verses
961,"And on the morrow, which is after the preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees came together to Pilate, ",selected_bible_verses
962,"saying: Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive: After three days I will rise. ",selected_bible_verses
963,"Command, therefore, that the sepulchre be made secure until the third day lest his disciples come and steal him away, and say to the people: He is risen from the dead; and the last error will be worse than the first. ",selected_bible_verses
964,"Pilate said to them: Ye have a watch; go, make secure, as ye know how. ",selected_bible_verses
965,"And they went, and made the sepulchre secure, sealing the stone, in connection with the watch.    XXVIII.  AND late in the sabbath, as it was dawning into the first day of the week, came Mary the Magdalene and the other Mary to view the sepulchre. ",selected_bible_verses
966,"And behold, there was a great earthquake. For an angel of the Lord, descending out of heaven, came and rolled away the stone, and sat upon it. ",selected_bible_verses
967,"His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow; ",selected_bible_verses
968,"and for fear of him the keepers shook, and became as dead men. ",selected_bible_verses
969,"And the angel answering said to the women: Fear not ye; for I know that ye are seeking Jesus, who was crucified. ",selected_bible_verses
970,"He is not here; for he is risen, as he said. Come hither, see the place where the Lord lay. ",selected_bible_verses
971,"And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead. And behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there ye shall see him. Behold, I told you.  ",selected_bible_verses
972,"And going out quickly from the sepulchre, with fear and great joy, they ran to bring his disciples word. ",selected_bible_verses
973,"And behold, Jesus met them, saying: All hail! And they, coming to him, laid hold of his feet, and worshiped him. ",selected_bible_verses
974,"Then Jesus says to them: Be not afraid; go, bear word to my brethren, to go away into Galilee, and there they shall see me.  ",selected_bible_verses
975,"And as they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and reported to the chief priests all the things that were done. ",selected_bible_verses
976,"And having assembled with the elders, and taken counsel, they gave much money to the soldiers, ",selected_bible_verses
977,"saying: Say, that his disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept. ",selected_bible_verses
978,"And they, taking the money, did as they were taught. And this saying was reported abroad among the Jews, until this day.  ",selected_bible_verses
979,"And the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into the mountain where Jesus had appointed them. ",selected_bible_verses
980,"And seeing him, they worshiped him; but some doubted.  ",selected_bible_verses
981,"And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying: All power was given to me in heaven and on earth. ",selected_bible_verses
982,"Go therefore, and disciple all the nations, immersing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit; ",selected_bible_verses
983,"teaching them to observe all things, whatever I commanded you. And, behold, I am with you alway, unto the end of the world.    THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO MARK.   I.  THE beginning of the good news of Jesus Christ, Son of God, ",selected_bible_verses
984,"as it is written in Isaiah the prophet: Behold, I send forth my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way; ",selected_bible_verses
985,"the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight his paths. ",selected_bible_verses
986,"John came immersing in the wilderness, and preaching the immersion of repentance unto remission of sins. ",selected_bible_verses
987,"And there went out to him all the country of Judaea, and all they of Jerusalem; and they were immersed by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.  ",selected_bible_verses
988,"And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a leathern girdle about his loins, and ate locusts and wild honey. ",selected_bible_verses
989,"And he preached, saying: There comes after me he that is mightier than I, the latchet of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and loose. ",selected_bible_verses
990,I indeed immersed you in water; but he will immerse you in the Holy Spirit.  ,selected_bible_verses
991,"And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was immersed by John in the Jordan. ",selected_bible_verses
992,"And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens parted, and the Spirit as a dove descending upon him. ",selected_bible_verses
993,And there came a voice out of heaven: Thou art my beloved son; in thee I am well pleased.  ,selected_bible_verses
994,And immediately the Spirit drives him forth into the wilderness. ,selected_bible_verses
995,"And he was in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan, and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered to him.  ",selected_bible_verses
996,"and saying: The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent, and believe in the good news.  ",selected_bible_verses
997,"And walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon, and Andrew, Simon's brother, casting a net in the sea; for they were fishermen. ",selected_bible_verses
998,"And Jesus said to them: Come after me, and I will cause you to become fishers of men. ",selected_bible_verses
999,"And immediately leaving the nets, they followed him.  ",selected_bible_verses
1000,"And going a little further, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending the nets. ",selected_bible_verses
1001,"And straightway he called them; and leaving their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, they went after him.  ",selected_bible_verses
1002,"And they enter into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath he went into the synagogue, and taught. ",selected_bible_verses
1003,"And they were astonished at his teaching; for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.  ",selected_bible_verses
1004,"And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit. And he cried out, ",selected_bible_verses
1005,"And Jesus rebuked him, saying: Hold thy peace, and come out of him. ",selected_bible_verses
1006,"And the unclean spirit, tearing him, and crying with a loud voice, came out of him. ",selected_bible_verses
1007,And immediately his fame spread abroad into all the surrounding region of Galilee.  ,selected_bible_verses
1008,"And immediately, having come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. ",selected_bible_verses
1009,And the mother-in-law of Simon was lying sick with fever; and immediately they tell him concerning her. ,selected_bible_verses
1010,"And he came and raised her up, taking hold of her hand; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered to them.  ",selected_bible_verses
1011,"And evening having come, when the sun set, they brought to him all that were sick, and those possessed with demons. ",selected_bible_verses
1012,And all the city was gathered together at the door. ,selected_bible_verses
1013,"And he healed many that were sick with divers diseases, and cast out many demons; and suffered not the demons to speak, because they knew him.  ",selected_bible_verses
1014,"And rising very early, by night, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed. ",selected_bible_verses
1015,"And Simon, and they who were with him, followed after him. ",selected_bible_verses
1016,"And having found him, they say to him: All are seeking thee. ",selected_bible_verses
1017,"And he says to them: Let us go elsewhere, into the neighboring towns, that I may preach there also; for, for this I came forth. ",selected_bible_verses
1018,"And he was preaching in their synagogues, throughout all Galilee, and casting out the demons.  ",selected_bible_verses
1019,"And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying to him: If thou wilt, thou canst cleanse me. ",selected_bible_verses
1020,"And Jesus, moved with compassion, stretched forth his hand and touched him, and says to him: I will; be thou cleansed. ",selected_bible_verses
1021,"And immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed. ",selected_bible_verses
1022,"And sternly charging him, he forthwith sent him away; ",selected_bible_verses
1023,"and says to him: See thou say nothing to any one; but go, show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing what Moses commanded, for a testimony to them. ",selected_bible_verses
1024,"But he, going forth, began to publish it much, and to spread abroad the report; so that he could no longer openly enter into a city, but was without in desert places. And they came to him from every quarter.    II.  AND again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was heard that he is in the house. ",selected_bible_verses
1025,"And straightway many were gathered together, so that there was no longer room, not even at the door; and he spoke the word to them.  ",selected_bible_verses
1026,"And they come to him, bringing one that was palsied, borne by four. ",selected_bible_verses
1027,"And not being able to come near him, on account of the multitude, they uncovered the roof where he was; and having broken it up, they let down the bed whereon the palsied man lay. ",selected_bible_verses
1028,"And Jesus, seeing their faith, says to the palsied man: Child, thy sins are forgiven. ",selected_bible_verses
1029,"But there were some of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts: ",selected_bible_verses
1030,"Why does this man speak thus? He blasphemes. Who can forgive sins but one, God? ",selected_bible_verses
1031,"And Jesus, immediately perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, said to them: Why reason ye these things in your hearts? ",selected_bible_verses
1032,"Which is easier, to say to the palsied man, Thy sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk? ",selected_bible_verses
1033,"But that ye may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins, (he says to the palsied man,) ",selected_bible_verses
1034,"I say to thee, arise, take up thy bed, and go to thy house. ",selected_bible_verses
1035,"And he arose, and immediately taking up the bed went forth before all; so that all were amazed, and glorified God, saying: We never saw it thus.  ",selected_bible_verses
1036,"And he went forth again by the sea-side; and all the multitude came to him, and he taught them.  ",selected_bible_verses
1037,"And passing along, he saw Levi the son of Alpheus sitting at the place of receiving custom, and said to him: Follow me. And rising up he followed him. ",selected_bible_verses
1038,"And it came to pass, as he reclined at table in his house, that many publicans and sinners were reclining with Jesus and his disciples; for there were many, and they followed him. ",selected_bible_verses
1039,"And the scribes and the Pharisees, seeing him eating with the sinners and publicans, said to his disciples: How is it that he eats and drinks with the sinners and the publicans? ",selected_bible_verses
1040,"And Jesus, hearing it, says to them: They who are well need not a physician, but they who are sick. I came not to call righteous men, but sinners.  ",selected_bible_verses
1041,"But days will come, when the bridegroom will be taken from them; and then they will fast in that day. ",selected_bible_verses
1042,"No one sews a piece of unfulled cloth upon an old garment; else the new filling up of the old takes from it, and a worse rent is made. ",selected_bible_verses
1043,"And the Pharisees said to him: Behold, why do they on the sabbath that which is not lawful? ",selected_bible_verses
1044,"And he said to them: Did ye never read what David did, when he had need and hungered, himself and they who were with him; ",selected_bible_verses
1045,"how he went into the house of God, in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the show-bread, which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to those who were with him? ",selected_bible_verses
1046,"And he said to them: The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath. ",selected_bible_verses
1047,"So that the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.    III.  AND he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there, having his hand withered. ",selected_bible_verses
1048,"And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath; that they might accuse him. ",selected_bible_verses
1049,"And he says to the man having the withered hand: Arise, and come into the midst. ",selected_bible_verses
1050,"And he says to them: Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath, or to do evil; to save life, or to kill? But they were silent. ",selected_bible_verses
1051,"And looking round on them with anger, being grieved for their hardness of heart, he says to the man: Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth; and his hand was restored.  ",selected_bible_verses
1052,"And going out, the Pharisees immediately took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him. ",selected_bible_verses
1053,"And Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea. And a great multitude from Galilee followed; and from Judaea, ",selected_bible_verses
1054,"and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and from beyond the Jordan, and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came to him. ",selected_bible_verses
1055,"And he spoke to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, that they might not throng him. ",selected_bible_verses
1056,"For he healed many, so that they pressed upon him to touch him, as many as had plagues. ",selected_bible_verses
1057,"And the unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying: Thou art the Son of God. ",selected_bible_verses
1058,And he strictly charged them that they should not make him known.  ,selected_bible_verses
1059,"And he goes up into the mountain, and calls to him whom he would; and they went to him. ",selected_bible_verses
1060,"And he appointed twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach, ",selected_bible_verses
1061,"and to have authority to heal sicknesses, and to cast out demons. ",selected_bible_verses
1062,And Simon he surnamed Peter; ,selected_bible_verses
1063,"and James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, Sons of thunder; ",selected_bible_verses
1064,"and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.  And they come into the house. ",selected_bible_verses
1065,"And the multitude comes together again, so that they could not even eat bread. ",selected_bible_verses
1066,"And hearing of it, his kinsmen went out to lay hold of him; for they said: He is beside himself.  ",selected_bible_verses
1067,"And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said: He has Beelzebul, and through the prince of the demons he casts out the demons. ",selected_bible_verses
1068,"And calling them to him, he said to them in parables: How can Satan cast out Satan? ",selected_bible_verses
1069,"And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom can not stand. ",selected_bible_verses
1070,"And if a house be divided against itself, that house can not stand. ",selected_bible_verses
1071,"And if Satan rose up against himself, and is divided, he can not stand, but has an end. ",selected_bible_verses
1072,"No one can enter into a strong man's house, and plunder his goods, except he first bind the strong man; and then he will plunder his house. ",selected_bible_verses
1073,"Verily I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and the blasphemies wherewith they shall blaspheme. ",selected_bible_verses
1074,"But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Spirit has no forgiveness forever, but is guilty of eternal sin; ",selected_bible_verses
1075,because they said: He has an unclean spirit.  ,selected_bible_verses
1076,"And his brothers and his mother come; and standing without they sent to him, calling him. ",selected_bible_verses
1077,"And a crowd was sitting about him; and they say to him: Behold, thy mother and thy brothers without are seeking thee. ",selected_bible_verses
1078,"And he answered them, saying: Who is my mother, or my brothers? ",selected_bible_verses
1079,"And looking round on those who sat about him, he said: Behold my mother, and my brothers! ",selected_bible_verses
1080,"For whoever shall do the will of God, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.    IV.  AND he began again to teach by the sea-side. And there was gathered to him a very great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat down in the sea; and all the multitude was by the sea on the land. ",selected_bible_verses
1081,"And he taught them many things in parables, and said to them in his teaching:  ",selected_bible_verses
1082,"Hearken; behold, the sower went forth to sow. ",selected_bible_verses
1083,"And it came to pass, as he sowed, one fell by the way-side, and the birds came and devoured it. ",selected_bible_verses
1084,"And another fell on the rocky ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had not depth of earth. ",selected_bible_verses
1085,"But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had not root, it withered away. ",selected_bible_verses
1086,"And another fell among the thorns; and the thorns came up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit. ",selected_bible_verses
1087,"And another fell into the good ground, and yielded fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, thirty, and sixty, and a hundredfold. ",selected_bible_verses
1088,"And he said: He that has ears to hear, let him hear.  ",selected_bible_verses
1089,"And when he was alone, they who were about him with the twelve asked him concerning the parables. ",selected_bible_verses
1090,"And he said to them: To you is given the mystery of the kingdom of God, but to those who are without, all things are done in parables; ",selected_bible_verses
1091,"that seeing they may see, and not perceive, and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest haply they should turn, and be forgiven. ",selected_bible_verses
1092,And he says to them: Know ye not this parable? And how will ye know all the parables?  ,selected_bible_verses
1093,The sower sows the word. ,selected_bible_verses
1094,"And these are they by the way-side; where the word is sown, and when they hear, Satan comes immediately and takes away the word that was sown in them. ",selected_bible_verses
1095,"And these are they likewise that are sown on the rocky places; who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with gladness; ",selected_bible_verses
1096,"and have no root in themselves, but are only for a time. Afterward, when affliction or persecution arises because of the word, immediately they are offended. ",selected_bible_verses
1097,"And others are they that are sown among the thorns. These are they that hear the word, ",selected_bible_verses
1098,"and the cares of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things, entering in choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful. ",selected_bible_verses
1099,"And these are they that are sown on the good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, in thirty, and in sixty, and in a hundredfold.  ",selected_bible_verses
1100,"And he said to them: Is the lamp brought that it may be put under the bushel, or under the bed? Is it not, that it may be put on the lamp-stand? ",selected_bible_verses
1101,"For nothing is hidden, but it shall be manifested; nor was done in secret, but that it should come abroad. ",selected_bible_verses
1102,"If any one has ears to hear, let him hear.  ",selected_bible_verses
1103,"And he said to them: Take heed what ye hear. With what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you, and there shall be added to you. ",selected_bible_verses
1104,"For he that has, to him shall be given; and he that has not, even what he has shall be taken from him.  ",selected_bible_verses
1105,"And he said: So is the kingdom of God, as when a man has cast the seed upon the earth, ",selected_bible_verses
1106,"and sleeps and rises night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows up, he knows not how. ",selected_bible_verses
1107,"For the earth brings forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear. ",selected_bible_verses
1108,"But when the fruit permits, immediately he puts forth the sickle, because the harvest is come.  ",selected_bible_verses
1109,"And he said: How shall we liken the kingdom of God, or in what comparison shall we set it forth? ",selected_bible_verses
1110,"As a grain of mustard; which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that are in the earth. ",selected_bible_verses
1111,"And when it is sown, it grows up, and becomes greater than all the herbs, and shoots out great branches; so that the birds of the air can lodge under its shadow.  ",selected_bible_verses
1112,"And with many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear. ",selected_bible_verses
1113,But without a parable he spoke not to them; and in private he explained all things to his disciples.  ,selected_bible_verses
1114,"And on that day, when evening was come, he says to them: Let us pass over to the other side. ",selected_bible_verses
1115,"And dismissing the multitude, they take him as he was in the ship. And there were also other ships with him. ",selected_bible_verses
1116,"And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that the ship was already becoming filled. ",selected_bible_verses
1117,"And he was in the stern, on the cushion, sleeping. And they awake him, and say to him: Teacher, carest thou not that we perish? ",selected_bible_verses
1118,"And awaking, he rebuked the wind, and said to the sea: Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. ",selected_bible_verses
1119,And he said to them: Why are ye so fearful? How is it that ye have no faith? ,selected_bible_verses
1120,"And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another: Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?    V.  AND they came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gerasenes. ",selected_bible_verses
1121,"And when he had come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit, ",selected_bible_verses
1122,"who had his dwelling in the tombs; and no one could any longer bind him, not even with chains. ",selected_bible_verses
1123,"Because he had often been bound with fetters and chains; and the chains had been torn asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces, and no one could tame him. ",selected_bible_verses
1124,"And always, night and day, he was in the tombs, and in the mountains, crying out, and cutting himself with stones. ",selected_bible_verses
1125,"But seeing Jesus afar off, he ran and bowed down to him, ",selected_bible_verses
1126,"and cried with a loud voice, and said: What have I to do with thee, Jesus, Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, do not torment me. ",selected_bible_verses
1127,"For he said to him: Come forth, unclean spirit, out of the man. ",selected_bible_verses
1128,And he asked him: What is thy name? And he says to him: My name is Legion; because we are many. ,selected_bible_verses
1129,And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.  ,selected_bible_verses
1130,"And there was there, by the mountain, a great herd of swine feeding. ",selected_bible_verses
1131,"And all the demons besought him, saying: Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them. ",selected_bible_verses
1132,"And immediately Jesus gave them leave. And coming out, the unclean spirits entered into the swine. And the herd rushed down the steep into the sea, about two thousand, and were choked in the sea. ",selected_bible_verses
1133,"And they who fed them fled, and reported it in the city and in the country. And they came to see what it was that was done. ",selected_bible_verses
1134,"And they come to Jesus, and see him who was possessed with demons, sitting, clothed and in his right mind, him who had the legion, and they were afraid. ",selected_bible_verses
1135,"And they who saw it related to them how it befell him who was possessed with demons, and concerning the swine. ",selected_bible_verses
1136,And they began to beseech him to depart from their borders.  ,selected_bible_verses
1137,"And as he was entering into the ship, he that had been possessed with demons besought him that he might be with him. ",selected_bible_verses
1138,"And he suffered him not; but says to him: Go into thy house, to thy friends, and announce to them how great things the Lord has done for thee, and had compassion on thee. ",selected_bible_verses
1139,"And he departed, and began to publish in the Decapolis how great things Jesus did for him; and all wondered.  ",selected_bible_verses
1140,"And Jesus having passed over again in the ship to the other side, a great multitude was gathered to him; and he was by the sea. ",selected_bible_verses
1141,"And there comes one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name. And seeing him, he fell at his feet, ",selected_bible_verses
1142,"and besought him much, saying: My little daughter lies at the point of death. I pray thee come, and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed and live. ",selected_bible_verses
1143,"And he went with him; and a great multitude was following him, and thronging him.  ",selected_bible_verses
1144,"And a certain woman, who had a flow of blood twelve years, ",selected_bible_verses
1145,"and had suffered much by many physicians, and spent all that she had, and was not at all benefited but rather grew worse, ",selected_bible_verses
1146,"hearing of Jesus, came in the crowd behind, and touched his garment. ",selected_bible_verses
1147,"For she said: If I touch even his garments, I shall be made whole. ",selected_bible_verses
1148,And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she perceived in her body that she was healed of that plague. ,selected_bible_verses
1149,"And immediately Jesus, perceiving in himself that power had gone forth from him, turned about in the crowd, and said: Who touched my garments? ",selected_bible_verses
1150,"And his disciples said to him: Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou: Who touched me? ",selected_bible_verses
1151,And he looked around to see her who had done this. ,selected_bible_verses
1152,"But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what was done to her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth. ",selected_bible_verses
1153,"And he said to her: Daughter, thy faith has made thee whole; go in peace, and be healed of thy plague.  ",selected_bible_verses
1154,"While he was yet speaking, they come from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying: Thy daughter is dead; why troublest thou the Teacher any further? ",selected_bible_verses
1155,"And Jesus, overhearing the word that was spoken, says to the ruler of the synagogue: Be not afraid; only believe. ",selected_bible_verses
1156,"And he suffered no one to follow with him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James. ",selected_bible_verses
1157,"And they come to the house of the ruler of the synagogue; and he sees a tumult, and those who wept and wailed greatly. ",selected_bible_verses
1158,"And entering in, he says to them: Why do ye make a tumult, and weep? The child is not dead, but is sleeping. ",selected_bible_verses
1159,"And they laughed him to scorn. But he, putting them all out, takes the father of the child, and the mother, and those who were with him, and enters in where the child was. ",selected_bible_verses
1160,"And taking the hand of the child, he says to her: Talitha kumi; which is interpreted, Damsel, I say to thee, arise. ",selected_bible_verses
1161,"And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment. ",selected_bible_verses
1162,"And he charged them strictly that no one should know this. And he commanded that something should be given her to eat.    VI.  AND he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and his disciples follow him. ",selected_bible_verses
1163,"And when the sabbath was come, he began to teach in the synagogue. And many hearing were astonished, saying: From whence has this man these things? And what is the wisdom which is given him, and such miracles wrought by his hands? ",selected_bible_verses
1164,"Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James, and Joses, and Judas, and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him. ",selected_bible_verses
1165,"And Jesus said to them: A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and among his own kindred, and in his own house. ",selected_bible_verses
1166,"And he was not able to do any miracle there, save that he laid his hands on a few sick, and healed them. ",selected_bible_verses
1167,"And he marveled because of their unbelief. And he went about the surrounding villages, teaching.  ",selected_bible_verses
1168,"And he called to him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them authority over the unclean spirits; ",selected_bible_verses
1169,"and commanded them that they should take nothing for the way, save a staff only; no bread, no bag, no money, in their girdle; ",selected_bible_verses
1170,"but that they be shod with sandals and, Put not on two coats. ",selected_bible_verses
1171,"And he said to them: Wherever ye enter into a house, there abide till ye depart from thence. ",selected_bible_verses
1172,"And they went out, and preached that men should repent. ",selected_bible_verses
1173,"And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.  ",selected_bible_verses
1174,"And the king, Herod, heard of it, for his name was spread abroad; and he said: John the Immerser is risen from the dead, and therefore do these powers work in him. ",selected_bible_verses
1175,"Others said: It is Elijah. And others said: It is a prophet, like any one of the prophets. ",selected_bible_verses
1176,"But Herod hearing of it, said: John, whom I beheaded, is risen from the dead. ",selected_bible_verses
1177,"For he, Herod, sent forth and laid hold of John, and bound him in prison, for the sake of Herodias the wife of Philip, his brother; because he had married her. ",selected_bible_verses
1178,For John said to Herod: It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife. ,selected_bible_verses
1179,"And Herodias was angry with him, and desired to put him to death; and she could not, ",selected_bible_verses
1180,"And a convenient day having come, when Herod on his birthday made a supper for his nobles, and for the chief captains, and the first men of Galilee; ",selected_bible_verses
1181,"and the daughter of Herodias having come in and danced, it pleased Herod and those reclining at table with him; and the king said to the damsel: Ask of me whatever thou wilt, and I will give it thee. ",selected_bible_verses
1182,"And he swore to her: Whatever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom. ",selected_bible_verses
1183,"And she, going out, said to her mother: What shall I ask? And she said: The head of John the Immerser. ",selected_bible_verses
1184,"And straightway she came in with haste to the king, and asked, saying: I will that immediately thou give me, on a platter, the head of John the Immerser. ",selected_bible_verses
1185,"And the king became very sorrowful; but for the sake of his oath, and of those reclining with him, he would not reject her. ",selected_bible_verses
1186,"And immediately the king sent one of the guard, and commanded to bring his head. And he went and beheaded him in the prison, ",selected_bible_verses
1187,"and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the damsel; and the damsel gave it to her mother. ",selected_bible_verses
1188,"And his disciples hearing of it came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.  ",selected_bible_verses
1189,"And the apostles gather together unto Jesus; and they reported to him all things, both what they did, and what they taught. ",selected_bible_verses
1190,"And he said to them: Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest awhile; for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure even to eat. ",selected_bible_verses
1191,And they departed into a desert place by ship privately. ,selected_bible_verses
1192,"And they saw them departing, and many knew them, and ran together there on foot from all the cities, and came before them. ",selected_bible_verses
1193,"And going forth he saw a great multitude, and had compassion on them, because they were as sheep having no shepherd; and he began to teach them many things.  ",selected_bible_verses
1194,"And the day being now far spent, his disciples come to him, and say: The place is desert, and the time is now far passed. ",selected_bible_verses
1195,"Dismiss them, that they may go away into the surrounding fields and villages, and buy themselves bread; for they have nothing to eat. ",selected_bible_verses
1196,"He answering said to them: Give ye them to eat. And they say to him: Shall we go and buy two hundred denaries worth of bread, and give them to eat? ",selected_bible_verses
1197,"He says to them: How many loaves have ye? Go and see. And when they knew, they say: Five, and two fishes. ",selected_bible_verses
1198,And he commanded them to make all lie down by companies on the green grass. ,selected_bible_verses
1199,"And they lay down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties. ",selected_bible_verses
1200,"And taking the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed and broke the loaves, and gave to the disciples to set before them; and the two fishes he divided among them all. ",selected_bible_verses
1201,"And they all ate, and were filled. ",selected_bible_verses
1202,"And they took up fragments filling twelve baskets, and part of the fishes. ",selected_bible_verses
1203,And they who ate of the loaves were five thousand men. ,selected_bible_verses
1204,"And straightway he constrained his disciples to enter into the ship, and to go before to the other side to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the multitude. ",selected_bible_verses
1205,"And having taken leave of them, he went away into the mountain to pray.  ",selected_bible_verses
1206,"And when evening was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he was alone on the land. ",selected_bible_verses
1207,"And he saw them distressed in rowing, for the wind was contrary to them. And about the fourth watch of the night he comes to them, walking on the sea, and would have passed by them. ",selected_bible_verses
1208,"And they seeing him walking on the sea, supposed it was a spectre, and cried out; ",selected_bible_verses
1209,"for all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and says to them: Be of good cheer; it is I, be not afraid. ",selected_bible_verses
1210,"And he went up to them into the ship; and the wind ceased. And they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered. ",selected_bible_verses
1211,For they considered not the loaves; for their heart was hardened.  ,selected_bible_verses
1212,"And passing over, they came to the land of Gennesaret, and anchored there. ",selected_bible_verses
1213,"And when they had come out of the ship, immediately recognizing him ",selected_bible_verses
1214,"they ran through all that region, and began to carry about on beds those who were sick, where they heard he was. ",selected_bible_verses
1215,"And wherever he entered, into villages, or cities, or fields, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the fringe of his garment. And as many as touched him were made whole.    VII.  AND there come together to him the Pharisees and certain of the scribes, who came from Jerusalem. ",selected_bible_verses
1216,"And seeing some of his disciples eating bread with defiled (that is, unwashen) hands, they found fault. ",selected_bible_verses
1217,"For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they carefully wash their hands, do not eat, holding the tradition of the elders. ",selected_bible_verses
1218,"And coming from the market, except they immerse themselves, they do not eat. And there are many other things which they received to hold, immersions of cups, and pots, and brazen vessels, and couches. ",selected_bible_verses
1219,"And the Pharisees and the scribes ask him: Why do not thy disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with defiled hands? ",selected_bible_verses
1220,"And he said to them: Well did Isaiah prophesy concerning you hypocrites; as it is written:      This people honor me with their lips,     But their heart is far from me.     ",selected_bible_verses
1221,"But in vain they worship me,     Teaching as doctrines commandments of men.  ",selected_bible_verses
1222,"For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, immersions of pots and cups; and many other such things ye do. ",selected_bible_verses
1223,"And he said to them: Well do ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition! ",selected_bible_verses
1224,"For Moses said: Honor thy father and thy mother; and he that curses father or mother, let him surely die. ",selected_bible_verses
1225,"and ye suffer him no more to do aught for his father or his mother, ",selected_bible_verses
1226,"annulling the word of God by your tradition, which ye handed down. And many such things ye do.  ",selected_bible_verses
1227,"And again calling to him the multitude, he said to them: Hearken to me every one, and understand. ",selected_bible_verses
1228,"There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him; but the things that come out of him, these are they that defile the man. ",selected_bible_verses
1229,"If any one has ears to hear, let him hear.  ",selected_bible_verses
1230,"And when he entered into the house from the multitude, his disciples asked him concerning the parable. ",selected_bible_verses
1231,"And he says to them: Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatever from without enters into the man can not defile him? ",selected_bible_verses
1232,"Because it enters not into his heart, but into the belly, and goes out into the drain, cleansing all food. ",selected_bible_verses
1233,"And he said: That which comes out of the man, that defiles the man. ",selected_bible_verses
1234,"For from within, out of the heart of men, come forth evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, ",selected_bible_verses
1235,"thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, wantonness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness. ",selected_bible_verses
1236,"All these evil things come forth from within, and defile the man.  ",selected_bible_verses
1237,"And rising up he departed thence into the borders of Tyre and Sidon; and entering into a house, he desired that no one should know it. And he could not be hidden. ",selected_bible_verses
1238,"For a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, hearing of him, came and fell at his feet. ",selected_bible_verses
1239,"The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast out the demon from her daughter. ",selected_bible_verses
1240,And he said to her: Let the children first be filled; for it is not good to take the children's bread and cast it to the dogs. ,selected_bible_verses
1241,"And she answered and said to him: Yea, Lord; for the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs. ",selected_bible_verses
1242,And he said to her: For this saying go thy way; the demon has gone out of thy daughter. ,selected_bible_verses
1243,"And departing to her house, she found the little child laid on the bed, and the demon gone out.  ",selected_bible_verses
1244,"And again going forth out of the borders of Tyre, he came through Sidon to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the borders of Decapolis. ",selected_bible_verses
1245,"And they bring to him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him. ",selected_bible_verses
1246,"And taking him aside from the multitude he put his fingers into his ears, and spitting, touched his tongue, ",selected_bible_verses
1247,"and looking up to heaven, he sighed, and says to him: Ephphatha, that is, Be opened. ",selected_bible_verses
1248,"And straightway his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke plainly. ",selected_bible_verses
1249,"And he charged them that they should tell no one. But the more he charged them, the more abundantly they published it; ",selected_bible_verses
1250,"and were beyond measure astonished, saying: He has done all things well; he makes both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.    VIII.  IN those days, there being a very great multitude, and they having nothing to eat, he called to him his disciples, and says to them: ",selected_bible_verses
1251,"I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat; ",selected_bible_verses
1252,"and if I dismiss them fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way; and some of them have come from afar. ",selected_bible_verses
1253,"And his disciples answered him: From whence will one be able to satisfy these men with bread, here in a wilderness? ",selected_bible_verses
1254,And he asked them: How many loaves have ye? And they said: Seven. ,selected_bible_verses
1255,"And he commanded the multitude to lie down on the ground. And he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and broke, and gave to his disciples to set before them; and they set them before the multitude. ",selected_bible_verses
1256,"And they had a few small fishes; and having blessed them, he commanded to set these also before them. ",selected_bible_verses
1257,"And they ate, and were filled; and they took up of the fragments that were left seven baskets. ",selected_bible_verses
1258,And they were about four thousand. And he dismissed them.  ,selected_bible_verses
1259,"And straightway entering into the ship with his disciples, he came into the region of Dalmanutha. ",selected_bible_verses
1260,"And the Pharisees came out, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him. ",selected_bible_verses
1261,"And sighing deeply in his spirit, he says: Why does this generation seek a sign? Verily I say to you, there shall no sign be given to this generation. ",selected_bible_verses
1262,"And leaving them, he entered again into the ship, and departed to the other side.  ",selected_bible_verses
1263,"And they forgot to take bread; and they had none in the ship with them, except one loaf. ",selected_bible_verses
1264,"And he charged them, saying: Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod. ",selected_bible_verses
1265,"And they reasoned among themselves, saying: It is because we have no bread. ",selected_bible_verses
1266,"And Jesus knowing it, says to them: Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? Do ye not yet perceive, nor understand? Have ye your heart yet hardened? ",selected_bible_verses
1267,"Having eyes, do ye not see? And having ears, do ye not hear? And do ye not remember? ",selected_bible_verses
1268,"When I broke the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments did ye take up? They say to him: Twelve. ",selected_bible_verses
1269,"And when the seven among the four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments did ye take up? And they said: Seven. ",selected_bible_verses
1270,And he said to them: How is it that ye do not understand?  ,selected_bible_verses
1271,"And they come to Bethsaida. And they bring to him a blind man, and beseech him to touch him. ",selected_bible_verses
1272,"And taking the blind man by the hand, he led him forth out of the village; and spitting in his eyes, and putting his hands on him, he asked him if he beheld anything. ",selected_bible_verses
1273,And looking up he said: I behold men; for I see them as trees walking. ,selected_bible_verses
1274,"Then again he put his hands on his eyes, and he saw clearly; and he was restored, and saw all things distinctly. ",selected_bible_verses
1275,"And he sent him away to his house, saying: Go not even into the village, nor tell it to any in the village.  ",selected_bible_verses
1276,"And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the villages of Caesarea Philippi: And in the way he asked his disciples, saying to them: Who do men say that I am? ",selected_bible_verses
1277,"And they answered him saying: John the Immerser; and others, Elijah; and others, one of the prophets. ",selected_bible_verses
1278,And he asked them: But who do ye say that I am? And Peter answering says to him: Thou art the Christ. ,selected_bible_verses
1279,And he charged them that they should tell no one concerning him.  ,selected_bible_verses
1280,"And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, and the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again. ",selected_bible_verses
1281,"And he spoke that saying openly. And Peter, taking him aside, began to rebuke him. ",selected_bible_verses
1282,"But he turning about, and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter, saying: Get thee behind me, Satan; for thou thinkest not the things of God, but those of men.  ",selected_bible_verses
1283,"And calling to him the multitude, with his disciples, he said to them: Whoever desires to follow after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. ",selected_bible_verses
1284,"For whoever will save his life shall lose it; but whoever shall lose his life, for the sake of me and of the glad tidings, shall save it. ",selected_bible_verses
1285,"For what will it profit a man, to gain the whole world, and forfeit his soul? ",selected_bible_verses
1286,Or what shall a man give as an exchange for his soul? ,selected_bible_verses
1287,"For whoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him will also the Son of man be ashamed, when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.    IX.  AND he said to them: Verily I say to you, that there are some of those standing here, who shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God already come with power.  ",selected_bible_verses
1288,"And after six days Jesus takes with him Peter, and James, and John, and brings them up into a high mountain apart by themselves. And he was transfigured before them. ",selected_bible_verses
1289,"And his garments became shining, exceeding white as snow, such as no fuller on earth can whiten. ",selected_bible_verses
1290,And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses; and they were talking with Jesus. ,selected_bible_verses
1291,"And Peter answering said to Jesus: Master, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tents, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah. ",selected_bible_verses
1292,For he knew not what to say; for they were sore afraid. ,selected_bible_verses
1293,And there came a cloud overshadowing them; and a voice came out of the cloud: This is my beloved Son; hear ye him. ,selected_bible_verses
1294,"And suddenly, looking around, they no longer saw any one, but Jesus only with themselves.  ",selected_bible_verses
1295,"And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should relate what they had seen to no one, except when the Son of man shall have risen from the dead. ",selected_bible_verses
1296,"And they kept the saying, questioning among themselves, what is the rising from the dead.  ",selected_bible_verses
1297,"And they asked him, saying: Why say the scribes that Elijah must first come? ",selected_bible_verses
1298,"And he said to them: Elijah indeed comes first, and restores all things. And how is it written of the Son of man? That he must suffer many things, and be set at naught. ",selected_bible_verses
1299,"But I say to you, that Elijah also has come, and they did to him whatever they would, as it is written of him.  ",selected_bible_verses
1300,"And coming to his disciples he saw a great multitude about them, and scribes questioning with them. ",selected_bible_verses
1301,"And straightway all the multitude seeing him were greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him. ",selected_bible_verses
1302,And he asked them: What question ye with them? ,selected_bible_verses
1303,"And one of the multitude answered him: Teacher, I brought to thee my son, having a dumb spirit. ",selected_bible_verses
1304,"And wherever it lays hold of him, it tears him, and he foams, and gnashes his teeth, and he pines away. And I spoke to thy disciples, that they should cast it out; and they could not. ",selected_bible_verses
1305,"And he answering, says to them: O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to me. ",selected_bible_verses
1306,"And they brought him to him. And seeing him, straightway the spirit rent him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming. ",selected_bible_verses
1307,"And he asked his father: How long is it, since this came upon him? And he said: From a child. ",selected_bible_verses
1308,"And ofttimes it cast him both into the fire, and into the water, to destroy him. But if thou art able to do anything, have compassion on us, and help us. ",selected_bible_verses
1309,Jesus said to him: If thou art able! All things are possible to the believing. ,selected_bible_verses
1310,"And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said: I believe; help thou my unbelief. ",selected_bible_verses
1311,"And Jesus, seeing that a multitude came running together, rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him: Dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter into him no more. ",selected_bible_verses
1312,"And crying out, and rending him sorely, it came out of him. And he became as one dead; so that many said: He is dead. ",selected_bible_verses
1313,"But Jesus taking him by the hand, raised him, and he stood up.  ",selected_bible_verses
1314,"And when he had come into the house, his disciples asked him privately: Why could not we cast it out? ",selected_bible_verses
1315,"And he said to them: This kind can go out by nothing, except by prayer and fasting.  ",selected_bible_verses
1316,"And going forth from thence, they passed through Galilee and he would not that any one should know it. ",selected_bible_verses
1317,"For he taught his disciples, and said to them: The Son of man is delivered up into the hands of men, and they will kill him and when he is killed, after three days he will rise again. ",selected_bible_verses
1318,"But they understood not the saying, and were afraid to ask him.  ",selected_bible_verses
1319,And they came to Capernaum. And having come into the house he inquired of them: Of what were ye reasoning among yourselves by the way? ,selected_bible_verses
1320,"But they were silent; for by the way they had disputed with one another, who was greatest. ",selected_bible_verses
1321,"And sitting down, he called the twelve, and says to them: If any one desires to be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all. ",selected_bible_verses
1322,"And taking a child, he placed it in the midst of them; and folding it in his arms, he said to them: ",selected_bible_verses
1323,"Whoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receives me and whoever shall receive me, receives not me, but him who sent me.  ",selected_bible_verses
1324,"And John answered him, saying: Teacher, we saw one casting out demons in thy name, who follows not us; and we forbade him, because he follows not us. ",selected_bible_verses
1325,"But Jesus said: Forbid him not; for there is no one who shall do a miracle in my name, and can lightly speak evil of me. ",selected_bible_verses
1326,For he that is not against us is for us. ,selected_bible_verses
1327,"For whoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in that name, that ye are Christ's, verily I say to you, he shall not lose his reward. ",selected_bible_verses
1328,"And whoever shall cause one of these little ones that believe on me to offend, it is better for him that an upper millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea. ",selected_bible_verses
1329,"And if thy hand cause thee to offend, cut it off. It is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having the two hands to go into hell, into the fire that is unquenchable; ",selected_bible_verses
1330,"where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched. ",selected_bible_verses
1331,"And if thy foot cause thee to offend, cut it off. It is better for thee to enter into life lame, than having the two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that is unquenchable; ",selected_bible_verses
1332,"where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched. ",selected_bible_verses
1333,"And if thine eye cause thee to offend, pluck it out. It is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell-fire; ",selected_bible_verses
1334,"where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched. ",selected_bible_verses
1335,"For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt. ",selected_bible_verses
1336,"Salt is good; but if the salt become saltless, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another.    X.  AND rising up he goes thence into the borders of Judaea, and the further side of the Jordan. And again the multitudes come together to him; and as he was wont, he again taught them.  ",selected_bible_verses
1337,"And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, if it is lawful for a man to put away a wife, tempting him. ",selected_bible_verses
1338,And he answering said to them: What did Moses command you? ,selected_bible_verses
1339,"And they said: Moses permitted to write a bill of divorcement, and to put her away. ",selected_bible_verses
1340,And Jesus answering said to them: For your hardness of heart he wrote you this command. ,selected_bible_verses
1341,"But from the beginning of the creation, God made them male and female. ",selected_bible_verses
1342,"For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the two shall be one flesh. ",selected_bible_verses
1343,"So that they are no longer two, but one flesh. ",selected_bible_verses
1344,"What therefore God joined together, let not man put asunder.  ",selected_bible_verses
1345,And in the house his disciples asked him again concerning this. ,selected_bible_verses
1346,"And he says to them: Whoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, commits adultery against her. ",selected_bible_verses
1347,"And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she commits adultery.  ",selected_bible_verses
1348,"And they brought little children to him, that he might touch them; and the disciples rebuked those who brought them. ",selected_bible_verses
1349,"But Jesus seeing it, was much displeased, and said to them: Suffer the little children to come to me; forbid them not, for to such belongs the kingdom of God. ",selected_bible_verses
1350,"Verily I say to you, whoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, shall not enter therein. ",selected_bible_verses
1351,"And he folded them in his arms, put his hands on them, and blessed them.  ",selected_bible_verses
1352,"And as he was going forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeling to him, and asked him: Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life? ",selected_bible_verses
1353,"And Jesus said to him: Why callest thou me good? There is none good but one, God. ",selected_bible_verses
1354,"Thou knowest the commandments: Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honor thy father and mother. ",selected_bible_verses
1355,"And he answering said to him: Teacher, all these I kept from my youth. ",selected_bible_verses
1356,"And Jesus beholding him loved him, and said to him: One thing thou lackest; go, sell whatever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, take up the cross, and follow me. ",selected_bible_verses
1357,"And he became sad at that saying, and went away sorrowful; for he had great possessions.  ",selected_bible_verses
1358,"And looking around, Jesus says to his disciples: How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God! ",selected_bible_verses
1359,"And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answering again says to them: Children, how hard it is for those who trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God! ",selected_bible_verses
1360,"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. ",selected_bible_verses
1361,"And they were exceedingly amazed, saying among themselves: Who then can be saved? ",selected_bible_verses
1362,"And Jesus, looking on them, says: With men it is impossible, but not with God; for with God all things are possible.  ",selected_bible_verses
1363,"Peter began to say to him: Lo, we forsook all, and followed thee. ",selected_bible_verses
1364,"And Jesus answering said: Verily I say to you, there is no one who forsook house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for the sake of me and of the glad tidings, ",selected_bible_verses
1365,"but he shall receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions, and in the world to come eternal life. ",selected_bible_verses
1366,"But many first will be last, and the last first.  ",selected_bible_verses
1367,"And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem. And Jesus was going before them; and they were amazed, and as they followed they were afraid. And again he took with him the twelve, and began to say to them what things should happen to him: ",selected_bible_verses
1368,"Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man will be delivered up to the chief priests, and to the scribes; and they will condemn him to death and will deliver him up to the Gentiles; ",selected_bible_verses
1369,"and they will mock him, and scourge him, and spit upon him, and will kill him; and after three days he will rise again.  ",selected_bible_verses
1370,"And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come to him saying: Teacher, we desire that thou shouldst do for us whatever we shall ask. ",selected_bible_verses
1371,And he said to them: What do ye desire that I should do for you? ,selected_bible_verses
1372,"They said to him: Grant to us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy glory. ",selected_bible_verses
1373,"And Jesus said to them: Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink the cup that I drink, or to endure the immersion which I endure? ",selected_bible_verses
1374,"And they said to him: We are able. And Jesus said to them: Ye shall indeed drink the cup that I drink, and endure the immersion which I endure. ",selected_bible_verses
1375,"But to sit on my right hand, or on the left, is not mine to give, but is for them for whom it has been prepared.  ",selected_bible_verses
1376,"And the ten, hearing it, began to be much displeased with James and John. ",selected_bible_verses
1377,"But it is not so among you. But whoever would become great among you, shall be your minister; ",selected_bible_verses
1378,"and whoever would become chiefest of you, shall be servant of all. ",selected_bible_verses
1379,"For even the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.  ",selected_bible_verses
1380,"And they come to Jericho. And as he was going forth from Jericho with his disciples and a great multitude, the son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the way-side. ",selected_bible_verses
1381,"And hearing that it is Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out, and say: Son of David, Jesus, have mercy on me. ",selected_bible_verses
1382,"And many rebuked him, that he should hold his peace. But he cried all the more: Son of David, have mercy on me. ",selected_bible_verses
1383,"And Jesus stood still, and said: Call him. And they call the blind man, saying to him: Be of good cheer; rise, he calls thee. ",selected_bible_verses
1384,"And he, casting away his garment, leaped up, and came to Jesus. ",selected_bible_verses
1385,"And Jesus answering said to him: What wilt thou that I should do to thee? The blind man said to him: Lord, that I may receive sight. ",selected_bible_verses
1386,"And Jesus said to him: Go thy way; thy faith has made thee whole. And immediately he received sight, and followed him in the way.    XI.  AND when they come near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany at the mount of the Olives, he sends forth two of his disciples, ",selected_bible_verses
1387,"and says to them: Go into the village over against you; and immediately, on entering into it, ye will find a colt tied, whereon no man has sat; loose and bring him. ",selected_bible_verses
1388,And if any one say to you: Why do ye this? say: The Lord has need of him; and straightway he will send him hither. ,selected_bible_verses
1389,"And they departed, and found a colt tied by the door without, on the street; and they loose him. ",selected_bible_verses
1390,"And some of those standing there, said to them: What do ye, loosing the colt? ",selected_bible_verses
1391,And they said to them as Jesus commanded; and they let them go. ,selected_bible_verses
1392,"And they bring the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him; and he sat upon him. ",selected_bible_verses
1393,"And they that went before, and they that followed, cried: Hosanna! blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord; ",selected_bible_verses
1394,blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David; Hosanna in the highest! ,selected_bible_verses
1395,"And he entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple; and having looked around on all things, the evening being now come, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.  ",selected_bible_verses
1396,"And on the morrow, when they had come out from Bethany, he was hungry. ",selected_bible_verses
1397,"And seeing a fig-tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find anything thereon. And coming to it, he found nothing but leaves; for it was not the season of figs. ",selected_bible_verses
1398,"And answering he said to it: Let no one eat fruit from thee, henceforth forever. And his disciples heard it.  ",selected_bible_verses
1399,"And they come into Jerusalem. And entering into the temple, he began to cast out those who sold and bought in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers, and the seats of those who sold doves; ",selected_bible_verses
1400,and suffered not that any one should carry a vessel through the temple. ,selected_bible_verses
1401,"And he taught, saying to them: Is it not written: My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations? But ye have made it a den of robbers. ",selected_bible_verses
1402,"And the chief priests and the scribes heard it. And they sought how they might destroy him; for they feared him, for all the multitude was astonished at his teaching. ",selected_bible_verses
1403,"And when it became late, he went forth out of the city.  ",selected_bible_verses
1404,"And passing by in the morning, they saw the fig-tree dried up from the roots. ",selected_bible_verses
1405,"And Peter, calling to remembrance, says to him: Master, behold, the fig-tree which thou didst curse is withered away. ",selected_bible_verses
1406,And Jesus answering says to them: Have faith in God. ,selected_bible_verses

1408,"Therefore I say to you: All things whatever ye ask, when ye pray, believe that ye received, and ye shall have them.  ",selected_bible_verses
1409,"And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have aught against any one; that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses. ",selected_bible_verses
1410,"And they come again into Jerusalem. And as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders. ",selected_bible_verses
1411,"And they said to him: By what authority doest thou these things? And who gave thee this authority, to do these things? ",selected_bible_verses
1412,"And Jesus answering said to them: I also will ask you one thing; and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things. ",selected_bible_verses
1413,"John's immersion, was it from heaven, or from men? Answer me. ",selected_bible_verses
1414,"And they reasoned among themselves, saying: ",selected_bible_verses
1415,"If we say, from heaven; he will say, why then did ye not believe him? But shall we say from men? They feared the people; for all held that John was verily a prophet. ",selected_bible_verses
1416,"And answering they say to Jesus: We do not know. And Jesus says to them: Neither do I say to you, by what authority I do these things.    XII.  AND he began to speak to them in parables. A man planted a vineyard, and set a hedge about it, and dug a wine-vat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went abroad. ",selected_bible_verses
1417,"And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruits of the vineyard. ",selected_bible_verses
1418,"And they took him and beat him, and sent him away empty. ",selected_bible_verses
1419,"And again he sent to them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully treated. ",selected_bible_verses
1420,"And he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some. ",selected_bible_verses
1421,"Having yet therefore one beloved son, he sent him also to them last, saying: They will reverence my son. ",selected_bible_verses
1422,"But those husbandmen said among themselves: This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours. ",selected_bible_verses
1423,"And they took, and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard. ",selected_bible_verses
1424,"What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others. ",selected_bible_verses
1425,"And have ye not read this scripture:      The stone which the builders disallowed,     The same is become the head of the corner;     ",selected_bible_verses
1426,"This is from the Lord, and is wonderful in our eyes.  ",selected_bible_verses
1427,"And they sought to lay hold of him, but feared the people; for they knew that he spoke the parable against them; and they left him, and went away.  ",selected_bible_verses
1428,"And they send to him some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to entrap him with a word. ",selected_bible_verses
1429,"And they come and say to him: Teacher, we know that thou art true, and carest for no one; for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not? ",selected_bible_verses
1430,"And they brought it. And he says to them: Whose is this image, and the inscription? And they said to him: Caesar's. ",selected_bible_verses
1431,"And Jesus answering said to them: Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marveled at him.  ",selected_bible_verses
1432,"And there come to him Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection. And they asked him, saying: ",selected_bible_verses
1433,"Teacher, Moses wrote to us, that if one's brother die, and leave a wife behind, and leave no children, his brother should take the wife, and raise up seed to his brother. ",selected_bible_verses
1434,"There were seven brothers; and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed. ",selected_bible_verses
1435,"And the second took her, and died, and he also left no seed; and the third likewise. ",selected_bible_verses
1436,"And the seven took her, and left no seed. Last of all the woman died also. ",selected_bible_verses
1437,"In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise again, of which of them shall she be wife? For the seven had her for a wife. ",selected_bible_verses
1438,"Jesus answering said to them: Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the Scriptures, nor the power of God? ",selected_bible_verses
1439,"For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as angels who are in heaven. ",selected_bible_verses
1440,"And concerning the dead, that they rise, have ye not read in the book of Moses, at The Bush, how God spoke to him, saying: I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? ",selected_bible_verses
1441,"He is not God of the dead, but of the living. Ye greatly err.  ",selected_bible_verses
1442,"And one of the scribes came to him, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he answered them well, asked him: Which commandment is first of all? ",selected_bible_verses
1443,"And Jesus answered him: First is, Hear, O Israel; the Lord is our God, the Lord is one; ",selected_bible_verses
1444,"and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength. This is the first commandment. ",selected_bible_verses
1445,Second is this: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. There is no other commandment greater than these. ,selected_bible_verses
1446,"And the scribe said to him: Well, Teacher; thou saidst truly that he is one, and there is no other beside him; ",selected_bible_verses
1447,"and to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is more than all the whole-burnt-offerings and sacrifices. ",selected_bible_verses
1448,"And Jesus, seeing that he answered intelligently, said to him: Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no one dared any longer to question him.  ",selected_bible_verses
1449,"And Jesus answering said, while teaching in the temple: How say the scribes that the Christ is son of David? ",selected_bible_verses
1450,"For David himself said, in the Holy Spirit:      The LORD said to my Lord,     Sit on my right hand,     Till I put thy enemies under thy feet.  ",selected_bible_verses
1451,David himself calls him Lord; and whence is he his son? And the great multitude heard him gladly.  ,selected_bible_verses
1452,"And he said to them in his teaching: Beware of the scribes, who love to go about in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, ",selected_bible_verses
1453,"and the first seats in the synagogues, and the first places at the feasts; ",selected_bible_verses
1454,"who devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers; these shall receive greater condemnation.  ",selected_bible_verses
1455,"And sitting over against the treasury, he beheld how the people cast money into the treasury; and many that were rich cast in much. ",selected_bible_verses
1456,"And one poor widow came, and cast in two mites, which are a farthing. ",selected_bible_verses
1457,"And calling to him his disciples, he said to them: Verily I say to you, that this poor widow cast in more than all who are casting into the treasury. ",selected_bible_verses
1458,"For all cast in out of their abundance; but she, out of her want, cast in all that she had, her whole living.    XIII.  AND as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples says to him: Teacher, see what manner of stones, and what manner of buildings! ",selected_bible_verses
1459,"And Jesus said to him: Seest thou these great buildings? There shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.  ",selected_bible_verses
1460,"And as he was sitting on the mount of the Olives, over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately: ",selected_bible_verses
1461,"Tell us, when will these things be? And what is the sign when all these things are about to be accomplished.  ",selected_bible_verses
1462,And Jesus began to say to them: Take heed lest any one lead you astray. ,selected_bible_verses
1463,"For many will come in my name, saying: I am he; and will lead many astray. ",selected_bible_verses
1464,"And when ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars, be not troubled, for it must come to pass; but not yet is the end. ",selected_bible_verses
1465,"For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be earthquakes in divers places, and there will be famines and commotions; these are the beginning of sorrows.  ",selected_bible_verses
1466,"But do ye take heed to yourselves; for they will deliver you up to councils, and in the synagogues ye will be beaten; and ye will be brought before governors and kings for my sake for a testimony to them. ",selected_bible_verses
1467,And the good news must first be preached among all the nations.  ,selected_bible_verses
1468,"But when they lead you away to deliver you up, take not thought beforehand what ye shall speak nor premeditate; but whatever shall be given you in that hour, that speak; for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Spirit. ",selected_bible_verses
1469,"And the brother will deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child; and children will rise up against parents, and will put them to death. ",selected_bible_verses
1470,"And ye will be hated by all for my name's sake; but he that has endured unto the end, the same shall be saved.  ",selected_bible_verses
1471,"But when ye see the abomination of desolation standing where it ought not, (let him that reads, mark!) then let those in Judaea flee to the mountains. ",selected_bible_verses
1472,"And he that is upon the house, let him not go down into the house, nor enter in to take anything out of his house. ",selected_bible_verses
1473,"And he that is in the field, let him not turn back to take his garment.  ",selected_bible_verses
1474,"But woe to those who are with child, and to those who give suck in those days! ",selected_bible_verses
1475,And pray that it be not in the winter. ,selected_bible_verses
1476,"For in those days will be affliction, such as has not been from the beginning of the creation which God created until now, neither shall be. ",selected_bible_verses
1477,"And if the Lord had not shortened those days, no flesh would have been saved; but for the sake of the chosen, whom he chose, he shortened the days.  ",selected_bible_verses
1478,"And then if any one say to you: Lo, here is the Christ, or Lo, there, believe not. ",selected_bible_verses
1479,"For false Christs and false prophets will arise, and will show signs and wonders, so as to lead, if possible, even the chosen astray. ",selected_bible_verses
1480,But do ye take heed; I have foretold you all.  ,selected_bible_verses
1481,"But in those days, after that affliction, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light; ",selected_bible_verses
1482,"and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken. ",selected_bible_verses
1483,"And then shall they see the Son of man coming in clouds, with great power and glory. ",selected_bible_verses
1484,"And then will he send forth the angels, and gather together his chosen from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.  ",selected_bible_verses
1485,"And learn the parable from the fig-tree. When its branch is already become tender, and puts forth leaves, ye know that summer is near. ",selected_bible_verses
1486,"So also ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know that it is near, at the doors. ",selected_bible_verses
1487,"Verily I say to you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things are done. ",selected_bible_verses
1488,Heaven and earth shall pass away; but my words shall not pass away.  ,selected_bible_verses
1489,"But of that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father. ",selected_bible_verses
1490,"Take heed, watch; for ye know not when the time is. ",selected_bible_verses
1491,"As a man who is abroad, having left his house, and given authority to his servants, to each one his work, also commanded the porter that he should watch; ",selected_bible_verses
1492,"watch therefore, for ye know not when the master of the house comes, at evening, or at midnight, or at the cock-crowing, or in the morning; ",selected_bible_verses
1493,lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping. ,selected_bible_verses
1494,"And what I say to you, I say to all, Watch.    XIV.  TWO days after, was the passover, and the feast of unleavened bread; and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft, and put him to death. ",selected_bible_verses
1495,"For they said: Not at the feast, lest there shall be a tumult of the people.  ",selected_bible_verses
1496,"And he being in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, as he was reclining at table, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of pure spikenard, very precious; and she broke the box, and poured it on his head. ",selected_bible_verses
1497,"And there were some that were much displeased among themselves, and said: Why was this waste of the ointment made? ",selected_bible_verses
1498,"For this ointment could have been sold for more than three hundred denaries, and given to the poor. And they murmured at her. ",selected_bible_verses
1499,And Jesus said: Let her alone; why do ye trouble her? She wrought a good work on me. ,selected_bible_verses
1500,"For the poor ye have always with you, and when ye will ye can do good to them; but me ye have not always. ",selected_bible_verses
1501,She did what she could; she beforehand anointed my body for the preparation for burial. ,selected_bible_verses
1502,"Verily I say to you, wherever the good news shall be preached in the whole world, this also that she did shall be told for a memorial of her.  ",selected_bible_verses
1503,"And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests, to deliver him up to them. ",selected_bible_verses
1504,"And they, when they heard it, were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently deliver him up.  ",selected_bible_verses
1505,"And on the first day of the feast of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples say to him: Where wilt thou that we go and prepare, that thou mayest eat the passover? ",selected_bible_verses
1506,"And he sends forth two of his disciples, and says to them: Go into the city, and there will meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water; follow him. ",selected_bible_verses
1507,"And where he shall go in, say to the master of the house: The Teacher says, Where is the guest-chamber, in which I may eat the passover with my disciples? ",selected_bible_verses
1508,"And he will show you a large upper room furnished, ready; there prepare for us. ",selected_bible_verses
1509,"And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he said to them; and they made ready the passover.  ",selected_bible_verses
1510,And at evening he comes with the twelve. ,selected_bible_verses
1511,"And as they were reclining at table, and eating, Jesus said: Verily I say to you, that one of you will betray me, one that eats with me! ",selected_bible_verses
1512,"And they began to be sorrowful, and to say to him one by one: Is it I? And another said: Is it I? ",selected_bible_verses
1513,"And he answering said to them: It is one of the twelve, one that dips with me into the dish. ",selected_bible_verses
1514,"The Son of man indeed goes, as it is written of him; but woe to that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! It were good for him if that man had not been born.  ",selected_bible_verses
1515,"And as they were eating, Jesus, taking a loaf, blessed, and broke, and gave it to them, and said: Take it; this is my body. ",selected_bible_verses
1516,"And taking the cup, he gave thanks, and gave it to them; and they all drank of it. ",selected_bible_verses
1517,"And he said to them: This is my blood of the covenant, which is shed for many. ",selected_bible_verses
1518,"Verily I say to you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.  ",selected_bible_verses
1519,"And having sung, they went out into the mount of the Olives. ",selected_bible_verses
1520,"And Jesus says to them: All ye will be offended; because it is written: I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered. ",selected_bible_verses
1521,"But after I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.  ",selected_bible_verses
1522,"And Peter said to him: Though all shall be offended, yet will not I. ",selected_bible_verses
1523,"And Jesus says to him: Verily I say to thee, that thou this day, in this night, before a cock crows twice, wilt thrice deny me. ",selected_bible_verses
1524,"But he said the more vehemently: If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee. Likewise also said they all.  ",selected_bible_verses
1525,"And they come to a place which was named Gethsemane. And he says to his disciples: Sit ye here, while I shall pray. ",selected_bible_verses
1526,"And he takes with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be troubled. ",selected_bible_verses
1527,"And he says to them: My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, unto death; tarry here, and watch. ",selected_bible_verses
1528,"And going forward a little, he fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him. ",selected_bible_verses
1529,"And he said: Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee; take away this cup from me; but not what I will, but what thou wilt.  ",selected_bible_verses
1530,"And he comes, and finds them sleeping. And he says to Peter: Simon, sleepest thou? Couldest thou not watch one hour? ",selected_bible_verses
1531,"Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.  ",selected_bible_verses
1532,"And again he went away and prayed, saying the same words. ",selected_bible_verses
1533,"And returning, he found them again sleeping, for their eyes were heavy; and they knew not what to answer him.  ",selected_bible_verses
1534,"Rise, let us go; behold, he that betrays me is at hand.  ",selected_bible_verses
1535,"And immediately, while he was yet speaking, comes Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders. ",selected_bible_verses
1536,"And his betrayer had given them a signal, saying: Whom I shall kiss, that is he; lay hold of him, and lead him away securely. ",selected_bible_verses
1537,"And coming, he goes straightway to him, and says: Master, Master; and kissed him.  ",selected_bible_verses
1538,"And they laid their hands on him, and held him fast. ",selected_bible_verses
1539,"And one of those standing by drew his sword, and smote the servant of the high priest, and took off his ear. ",selected_bible_verses
1540,"And Jesus answering said to them: Came ye out, as against a robber, with swords and staves to take me? ",selected_bible_verses
1541,"I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye did not lay hold of me; but that the Scriptures might be fulfilled! ",selected_bible_verses
1542,"And all forsook him, and fled.  ",selected_bible_verses
1543,"And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men lay hold of him. ",selected_bible_verses
1544,"And leaving behind the linen cloth, he fled from them naked.  ",selected_bible_verses
1545,And they led Jesus away to the high priest; and with him assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes. ,selected_bible_verses
1546,"And Peter followed him afar off, even into the court of the high priest, and was sitting with the officers, and warming himself at the fire.  ",selected_bible_verses
1547,"And the chief priests and all the council sought for testimony against Jesus, in order to put him to death; and they found none. ",selected_bible_verses
1548,For many bore false witness against him; but their testimonies agreed not together. ,selected_bible_verses
1549,"And certain ones rose up, and bore false witness against him, saying: ",selected_bible_verses
1550,"We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands. ",selected_bible_verses
1551,And not even so did their testimony agree.  ,selected_bible_verses
1552,"And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying: Answerest thou nothing? What do these witness against thee? ",selected_bible_verses
1553,"But he was silent, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said to him: Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed? ",selected_bible_verses
1554,"And Jesus said: I am; and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming with the clouds of heaven. ",selected_bible_verses
1555,"And the high priest, rending his clothes, says: What further need have we of witnesses? ",selected_bible_verses
1556,Ye heard the blasphemy. What think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.  ,selected_bible_verses
1557,"And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face and buffet him, and say to him: Prophesy. And the officers, with blows, took him in charge.  ",selected_bible_verses
1558,"And Peter being below in the court, there comes one of the maid-servants of the high priest; ",selected_bible_verses
1559,"and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said: Thou also wast with Jesus the Nazarene. ",selected_bible_verses
1560,"But he denied, saying: I do not know, nor do I understand what thou sayest. And he went out into the fore-court; and a cock crowed.  ",selected_bible_verses
1561,"And the maid-servant, seeing him, began again to say to those standing by: This is one of them. ",selected_bible_verses
1562,"And he again denied it.  And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter: Surely thou art one of them; for thou art a Galilaean. ",selected_bible_verses
1563,"But he began to invoke curses, and to swear: I do not know this man of whom ye speak. ",selected_bible_verses
1564,"And a cock crowed a second time. And Peter remembered the word, how Jesus said to him: Before a cock crows twice, thou wilt thrice deny me. And as he thought thereon, he wept.    XV.  AND straightway, in the morning, the chief priests with the elders and scribes and the whole council, having held a consultation, bound Jesus and carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate. ",selected_bible_verses
1565,And Pilate asked him: Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said to him: Thou sayest it. ,selected_bible_verses
1566,And the chief priests accused him of many things.  ,selected_bible_verses
1567,"And Pilate asked him again, saying: Answerest thou nothing? Behold what things they testify against thee. ",selected_bible_verses
1568,But Jesus no longer made any answer; so that Pilate marveled.  ,selected_bible_verses
1569,"And at the feast he released to them one prisoner, whomsoever they asked. ",selected_bible_verses
1570,"And there was the one called Barabbas, bound with his companions in sedition, who in the sedition had committed murder. ",selected_bible_verses
1571,"And coming up, the multitude began to make request, according as he had always done for them. ",selected_bible_verses
1572,"And Pilate answered them, saying: Will ye that I release to you the King of the Jews? ",selected_bible_verses
1573,For he knew that through envy the chief priests had delivered him up. ,selected_bible_verses
1574,"But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should rather release to them Barabbas. ",selected_bible_verses
1575,"And Pilate answering, said again to them: What will ye then that I shall do to him whom ye call the King of the Jews? ",selected_bible_verses
1576,And they cried again: Crucify him. ,selected_bible_verses
1577,And Pilate said to them: What evil then has he done? And they cried the more exceedingly: Crucify him.  ,selected_bible_verses
1578,"And Pilate, wishing to satisfy the multitude, released to them Barabbas; and he delivered up Jesus, after scourging him, to be crucified. ",selected_bible_verses
1579,"And the soldiers led him away into the court, which is Praetorium; and they call together the whole band. ",selected_bible_verses
1580,"And they clothe him with purple, and having platted a crown of thorns, they put it on him. ",selected_bible_verses
1581,"And they began to salute him: Hail, King of the Jews! ",selected_bible_verses
1582,"And they smote him on the head with a reed, and spit upon him, and kneeling down, did homage to him. ",selected_bible_verses
1583,"And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put on him his own garments.  And they lead him out to crucify him. ",selected_bible_verses
1584,"And they compel one Simon, a Cyrenian, who was passing by, coming from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross. ",selected_bible_verses
1585,"And they bring him to the place Golgotha, which is interpreted, Place of a skull. ",selected_bible_verses
1586,And they gave him wine mingled with myrrh; but he took it not. ,selected_bible_verses
1587,"And having crucified him, they divide his garments, casting lots upon them, what any one should take. ",selected_bible_verses
1588,And it was the third hour; and they crucified him. ,selected_bible_verses
1589,And the inscription of the accusation against him was written over: THE KING OF THE JEWS.  ,selected_bible_verses
1590,"And with him they crucify two robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left. ",selected_bible_verses
1591,"And the scripture was fulfilled, which says: And he was reckoned with transgressors. ",selected_bible_verses
1592,"And they that passed by railed at him, wagging their heads, and saying: Aha, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days; ",selected_bible_verses
1593,"save thyself, and come down from the cross. ",selected_bible_verses
1594,"Likewise also the chief priests, mocking one with another, together with the scribes, said: Others he saved, himself he can not save. ",selected_bible_verses
1595,"Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reproached him.  ",selected_bible_verses
1596,"And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. ",selected_bible_verses
1597,"And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying: Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? Which is interpreted: My God, my God, why didst thou forsake me? ",selected_bible_verses
1598,"And some of those standing by, hearing it, said: Behold, he calls Elijah. ",selected_bible_verses
1599,"And one ran and filled a sponge with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying: Let alone; let us see whether Elijah comes to take him down. ",selected_bible_verses
1600,"And Jesus, uttering a loud cry, expired. ",selected_bible_verses
1601,"And the vail of the temple was rent in twain, from the top to the bottom. ",selected_bible_verses
1602,"And the centurion who was standing near, over against him, seeing that he so cried out and expired, said: Truly this man was the Son of God.  ",selected_bible_verses
1603,"And there were also women looking on afar off; among whom was also Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome; ",selected_bible_verses

1608,"And having bought fine linen, and taken him down, he wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone to the door of the sepulchre. ",selected_bible_verses
1609,"And Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother of Joses, beheld where he was laid.    XVI.  AND the sabbath being past, Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought spices, that they might come and anoint him.  ",selected_bible_verses

1629,"it seemed good to me also, having accurately traced all from the very first, to write to thee in order, most excellent Theophilus; ",selected_bible_verses
1630,"There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest, Zachariah by name, of the course of Abijah; and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth. ",selected_bible_verses

1640,"For he shall be great before the Lord; and he shall not drink wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb. ",selected_bible_verses

1643,"And Zachariah said to the angel: Whereby shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is far advanced in years. ",selected_bible_verses
1644,"And the angel answering said to him: I am Gabriel, that stands in the presence of God; and I was sent to speak to thee, and to bring thee these glad tidings. ",selected_bible_verses
1645,"And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou didst not believe thy words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.  ",selected_bible_verses
1646,And the people were waiting for Zachariah; and they were wondering at his long tarrying in the temple. ,selected_bible_verses
1647,"And when he came out he was not able to speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple; and he was making signs to them, and remained speechless.  ",selected_bible_verses
1648,"And it came to pass, when the days of his ministration were completed, that he departed to his own house.  ",selected_bible_verses
1649,"And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived; and she hid herself five months, saying: ",selected_bible_verses
1650,"Thus has the Lord dealt with me, in the days wherein he looked on me to take away my reproach among men.  ",selected_bible_verses
1651,"And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, ",selected_bible_verses
1652,"to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary. ",selected_bible_verses
1653,"And the angel coming in to her, said: Hail, highly favored! The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women. ",selected_bible_verses
1654,And she was troubled at the saying; and was considering what manner of salutation this might be. ,selected_bible_verses
1655,"And the angel said to her: Fear not, Mary; for thou didst find favor with God. ",selected_bible_verses
1656,"And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus. ",selected_bible_verses
1657,"He shall be great, and shall be called Son of the Highest; and the Lord God will give to him the throne of David his father; ",selected_bible_verses

1659,"Then said Mary to the angel: How shall this be, seeing that I know not a man? ",selected_bible_verses

1662,And Mary said: Behold the handmaid of the Lord; let it be to me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.  ,selected_bible_verses
1663,"And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill-country with haste, into a city of Judah; ",selected_bible_verses
1664,"and entered into the house of Zachariah, and saluted Elisabeth. ",selected_bible_verses
1665,"And it came to pass, as Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, that the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. ",selected_bible_verses
1666,"And she spoke out with a loud voice and said: Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. ",selected_bible_verses
1667,"And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? ",selected_bible_verses
1668,"For, behold, as the voice of thy salutation came into my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy. ",selected_bible_verses
1669,And Mary said: My soul magnifies the Lord; ,selected_bible_verses
1670,and my spirit rejoiced in God my Savior. ,selected_bible_verses
1671,"Because he looked upon the low estate of his handmaid; for, behold, henceforth all generations will call me happy. ",selected_bible_verses
1672,Because the Mighty One did great things for me; and holy is his name. ,selected_bible_verses
1673,"And his mercy is from generation to generation, to those who fear him. ",selected_bible_verses
1674,He wrought might with his arm; he scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts. ,selected_bible_verses
1675,"He cast down princes from thrones, and exalted those of low degree. ",selected_bible_verses
1676,"The hungry he filled with good, and the rich he sent empty away. ",selected_bible_verses
1677,"He helped Israel, his servant; to remember mercy, ",selected_bible_verses

1679,"And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house.  ",selected_bible_verses
1680,Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son. ,selected_bible_verses
1681,And her neighbors and her kindred heard that the Lord showed great mercy toward her; and they rejoiced with her.  ,selected_bible_verses
1682,"And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zachariah, after the name of his father. ",selected_bible_verses
1683,And his mother answered and said: Nay; but he shall be called John. ,selected_bible_verses
1684,And they said to her: There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name. ,selected_bible_verses
1685,"And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called. ",selected_bible_verses
1686,"And asking for a writing-tablet, he wrote, saying: His name is John. And they all wondered. ",selected_bible_verses
1687,"And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue was loosed; and he spoke, blessing God. ",selected_bible_verses
1688,"And all who heard laid them up in their hearts, saying: What then will this child be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.  ",selected_bible_verses
1689,"And Zachariah his father was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying: ",selected_bible_verses
1690,"Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, that he visited and wrought redemption for his people; ",selected_bible_verses
1691,"and raised up a horn of salvation for us, in the house of David his servant, ",selected_bible_verses
1692,"(as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets of old,) ",selected_bible_verses
1693,"salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us; ",selected_bible_verses
1694,"to show mercy to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant; ",selected_bible_verses
1695,"the oath which he swore to Abraham our father, ",selected_bible_verses
1696,"to grant to us, that without fear, being rescued from the hand of our enemies, we should serve him, ",selected_bible_verses

1700,"through the tender mercies of our God, whereby the dayspring from on high visited us, ",selected_bible_verses

1702,"And the child grew, and became strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his manifestation to Israel.    II.  AND it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be registered. ",selected_bible_verses
1703,This registering was the first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria. ,selected_bible_verses
1704,"And all went to be registered, each one to his own city. ",selected_bible_verses

1707,"And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were completed that she should bring forth. ",selected_bible_verses
1708,"And she brought forth her first-born son, and wrapped him in swathing bands, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.  ",selected_bible_verses

1710,"And, behold, an angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them; and they were sore afraid. ",selected_bible_verses
1711,"And the angel said to them: Fear not; for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all the people. ",selected_bible_verses
1712,"For to you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. ",selected_bible_verses
1713,"And this shall be to you the sign: Ye will find a babe wrapped in swathing bands, lying in a manger. ",selected_bible_verses
1714,"And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying: ",selected_bible_verses
1715,"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will among men.  ",selected_bible_verses
1716,"And it came to pass, when the angels were gone away from them into heaven, that the shepherds said one to another: Let us go now unto Bethlehem, and see this thing that is come to pass, which the Lord made known to us. ",selected_bible_verses
1717,"And they came with haste, and found both Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger. ",selected_bible_verses
1718,"And having seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child. ",selected_bible_verses
1719,And all that heard wondered at the things which were told them by the shepherds. ,selected_bible_verses
1720,"And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all that they heard and saw, as it was told to them.  ",selected_bible_verses
1721,"And when eight days were completed for circumcising him, his name was called Jesus; the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.  ",selected_bible_verses
1722,"And when the days of their purification, according to the law of Moses, were completed, they brought him up to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord, ",selected_bible_verses

1724,"and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the law of the Lord: A pair of turtle-doves, or two young pigeons.  ",selected_bible_verses
1725,"And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and this man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel; and the Holy Spirit was upon him, ",selected_bible_verses
1726,"And it was revealed to him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Christ of the Lord. ",selected_bible_verses
1727,"And he came by the Spirit into the temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law, ",selected_bible_verses
1728,"then he took him into his arms, and blessed God, and said: ",selected_bible_verses
1729,"Now, Lord, thou lettest thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word; ",selected_bible_verses
1730,"because my eyes saw thy salvation, ",selected_bible_verses
1731,"which thou preparedst before the face of all the peoples, ",selected_bible_verses
1732,"a light for a revelation to the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.  ",selected_bible_verses
1733,And his father and mother wondered at the things spoken of him. ,selected_bible_verses
1734,"And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother: Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that shall be spoken against, ",selected_bible_verses
1735,"(and a sword shall pierce through thine own soul also), that thoughts from many hearts may be revealed.  ",selected_bible_verses
1736,"And there was Anna, a prophetess, daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was of great age, and had lived with a husband seven years from her virginity; ",selected_bible_verses
1737,"and she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, who departed not from the temple, serving day and night with fastings and prayers. ",selected_bible_verses
1738,"And she, coming up at that very time, likewise gave thanks to the Lord, and spoke of him to all that were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.  ",selected_bible_verses
1739,"And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth. ",selected_bible_verses
1740,"And the child grew, and became strong, being filled with wisdom; and the favor of God was upon him.  ",selected_bible_verses
1741,And his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover. ,selected_bible_verses
1742,"And when he was twelve years old, they having gone up according to the custom of the feast, ",selected_bible_verses
1743,"and completed the days, as they returned, Jesus the child remained behind in Jerusalem. And his parents knew it not, ",selected_bible_verses
1744,"but supposing that he was in the company, went a day's journey, and sought him among their kindred and acquaintance; ",selected_bible_verses
1745,"and not finding him, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking him.  ",selected_bible_verses
1746,"And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing them, and asking them questions. ",selected_bible_verses
1747,"And all that heard him, were astonished at his understanding and answers. ",selected_bible_verses
1748,"And seeing him they were amazed. And his mother said to him: Child, why didst thou thus deal with us? Behold, thy father and I sought thee, sorrowing. ",selected_bible_verses
1749,And they understood not the saying which he spoke to them.  ,selected_bible_verses
1750,"And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them. And his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.  ",selected_bible_verses
1751,"And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.    III.  NOW in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judaea, and Herod tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch, of Iturea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene, ",selected_bible_verses
1752,"when Annas was high priest and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John, the son of Zachariah, in the wilderness. ",selected_bible_verses

1757,"He said therefore to the multitudes that came out to be immersed by him: Brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? ",selected_bible_verses
1758,"Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance; and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for our father; for I say to you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham. ",selected_bible_verses
1759,"And now also the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore, that brings not forth good fruit, is cut down and cast into the fire.  ",selected_bible_verses
1760,"And the multitudes asked him, saying: What then shall we do? ",selected_bible_verses
1761,"He answering says to them: He that has two coats, let him impart to him that has none; and he that has food, let him do likewise.  ",selected_bible_verses
1762,"And there came also publicans to be immersed; and they said to him: Teacher, what shall we do? ",selected_bible_verses
1763,And he said to them: Exact no more than that which is appointed you. ,selected_bible_verses
1764,"And while the people were in expectation, and all were reasoning in their hearts concerning John, whether he himself were not the Christ, ",selected_bible_verses
1765,"John answered them all, saying: I indeed immerse you in water; but there comes he that is mightier than I, the latchet of whose sandals I am not worthy to loose; he will immerse you in the Holy Spirit and fire; ",selected_bible_verses
1766,"whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing-floor, and will gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn up with fire unquenchable.  ",selected_bible_verses

1808,"And he said to them: Ye will surely say to me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself. Whatever we heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country. ",selected_bible_verses
1809,"And he said: Verily I say to you, no prophet is accepted in his own country. ",selected_bible_verses
1810,"But I tell you of a truth, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when there was a great famine throughout all the land; ",selected_bible_verses
1811,"and to none of them was Elijah sent, but unto Zarephath of Sidonia, to a woman that was a widow. ",selected_bible_verses
1812,"And there were many lepers in Israel, in the time of Elisha the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian. ",selected_bible_verses
1813,"And all in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath. ",selected_bible_verses
1814,"And they rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him to the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, to cast him down headlong. ",selected_bible_verses
1815,"But he, passing through the midst of them, went away.  ",selected_bible_verses
1816,"And he came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. And he was teaching them on the sabbath; ",selected_bible_verses
1817,"and they were astonished at his teaching, because his word was with power.  ",selected_bible_verses
1818,"And in the synagogue there was a man having a spirit of an unclean demon; and he cried out with a loud voice, ",selected_bible_verses
1819,"saying: Ah! what have we to do with thee, Jesus of Nazareth? Didst thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God. ",selected_bible_verses
1820,"And Jesus rebuked him, saying: Hold thy peace, and come out from him. And the demon throwing him in the midst came out from him, doing him no harm. ",selected_bible_verses
1821,"And amazement came on all; and they spoke with one another, saying: What is this word, that with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out? ",selected_bible_verses
1822,And there went out a rumor concerning him into every place of the country around.  ,selected_bible_verses
1823,"And standing over her he rebuked the fever, and it left her; and immediately she arose and ministered to them.  ",selected_bible_verses
1824,"Now when the sun was setting, all that had any sick with divers diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on each one of them, and healed them. ",selected_bible_verses
1825,"And demons also came out from many, crying out, and saying: Thou art the Son of God. And he, rebuking them, suffered them not to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.  ",selected_bible_verses
1826,"And when it was day he went out, and went into a desert place. And the multitudes sought him, and came to him, and stayed him, that he should not depart from them. ",selected_bible_verses
1827,And he said to them: I must publish the good news of the kingdom of God to other cities also; because for this I was sent forth. ,selected_bible_verses
1828,"And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.    V.  AND it came to pass, as the multitude pressed upon him to hear the word of God, and he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret, ",selected_bible_verses
1829,"that he saw two ships standing by the lake; but the fishermen had gone out of them, and were washing the nets. ",selected_bible_verses
1830,"And entering into one of the ships, which was Simon's, he asked him to put out a little from the land. And sitting down, he taught the multitudes out of the ship.  ",selected_bible_verses
1831,"And when he ceased speaking, he said to Simon: Put out into the deep; and do ye let down your nets for a draught. ",selected_bible_verses
1832,"And Simon answering said to him: Master, we toiled all night and took nothing; but at thy word I will let down the net. ",selected_bible_verses
1833,"And having done this, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes; and their net began to break. ",selected_bible_verses
1834,"And they beckoned to their partners in the other ship, to come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink. ",selected_bible_verses
1835,"And Simon Peter, seeing it, fell down at the knees of Jesus, saying: Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord. ",selected_bible_verses
1836,"For astonishment had seized him, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken; ",selected_bible_verses
1837,"and likewise also James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon.  And Jesus said to Simon: Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men. ",selected_bible_verses
1838,"And having brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him.  ",selected_bible_verses
1839,"And it came to pass, when he was in one of the cities, that there was a man full of leprosy. And seeing Jesus he fell on his face, and besought him, saying: Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst cleanse me. ",selected_bible_verses
1840,"And stretching forth his hand he touched him, saying: I will; be thou cleansed. And immediately the leprosy departed from him. ",selected_bible_verses
1841,"And he charged him to tell no one: But go, and show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.  ",selected_bible_verses
1842,"But all the more went abroad the report concerning him; and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed of their infirmities. ",selected_bible_verses
1843,"And he was wont to retire into the solitary places, and pray.  ",selected_bible_verses
1844,"And it came to pass, on a certain day, that he was teaching; and there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who had come out of every village of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem; and there was power of the Lord for healing them. ",selected_bible_verses
1845,"And, behold, men brought on a bed a man who was palsied; and they sought to bring him in, and to lay him before him. ",selected_bible_verses
1846,"And not finding by what way they might bring him in, because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with the couch into the midst before Jesus. ",selected_bible_verses
1847,"And seeing their faith he said: Man, thy sins are forgiven thee. ",selected_bible_verses
1848,"And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying: Who is this that speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone? ",selected_bible_verses
1849,"But Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, answering said to them: What reason ye in your hearts? ",selected_bible_verses
1850,"Which is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee; or to say, Arise and walk? ",selected_bible_verses
1851,"But that ye may know that the Son of man has power on the earth to forgive sins, (he said to the palsied man,) I say to thee, arise, and taking up thy couch go to thy house. ",selected_bible_verses
1852,"And immediately standing up before them, he took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his house, glorifying God. ",selected_bible_verses
1853,"And they were all amazed; and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying: We have seen strange things to-day.  ",selected_bible_verses
1854,"And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the place of receiving custom; and he said to him: Follow me. ",selected_bible_verses
1855,"And leaving all, he arose and followed him.  ",selected_bible_verses
1856,And Levi made him a great feast in his own house; and there was a great company of publicans and of others who reclined at the table with them. ,selected_bible_verses
1857,"And Jesus answering said to them: They who are well need not a physician, but they who are sick. ",selected_bible_verses
1858,"I have not come to call righteous men, but sinners to repentance.  ",selected_bible_verses
1859,"And they said to him: Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise those of the Pharisees, but thine eat and drink? ",selected_bible_verses
1860,"But days will come, when the bridegroom will be taken away from them; then shall they fast in those days. ",selected_bible_verses
1861,"And he spoke also a parable to them: No one rends a piece from a new garment, and puts it on an old garment; else both the new will make a rent, and the piece from the new agrees not with the old. ",selected_bible_verses
1862,"And no one puts new wine into old skins; else the new wine will burst the skins, and will itself be poured out, and the skins will perish. ",selected_bible_verses
1863,And some of the Pharisees said: Why do ye that which it is not lawful to do on the sabbath? ,selected_bible_verses
1864,"And Jesus answering them said: And have ye not read this, what David did when he hungered, himself and they who were with him; ",selected_bible_verses
1865,"how he went into the house of God, and took and ate the show-bread, and gave to those who were with him, which it is not lawful to eat except for the priests alone? ",selected_bible_verses
1866,And he said to them: The Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.  ,selected_bible_verses
1867,"And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught. And there was a man whose right hand was withered. ",selected_bible_verses
1868,"And the scribes and Pharisees were watching, whether he would heal on the sabbath; that they might find an accusation against him. ",selected_bible_verses
1869,"But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man having the withered hand: Arise, and stand forth in the midst. And he rose up, and stood. ",selected_bible_verses
1870,"And looking round on them all, he said to him: Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so, and his hand was restored. ",selected_bible_verses
1871,"And they were filled with madness, and conferred one with another, as to what they should do to Jesus.  ",selected_bible_verses
1872,"And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into the mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God. ",selected_bible_verses
1873,"And when it was day, he called to him his disciples. And having chosen from them twelve (whom he named also apostles); ",selected_bible_verses
1874,"Simon, whom he also named Peter, and Andrew his brother, and James and John, and Philip and Bartholomew, ",selected_bible_verses
1875,"and Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alpheus, and Simon called Zelotes, ",selected_bible_verses
1876,"and Judas brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a betrayer; ",selected_bible_verses
1877,"and having come down with them, he stood on a plain, and a company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people from all Judaea and Jerusalem and the sea-coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases; ",selected_bible_verses
1878,and those vexed by unclean spirits were healed; ,selected_bible_verses
1879,"and all the multitude sought to touch him, because power went out from him and healed them all.  ",selected_bible_verses
1880,"And he, lifting up his eyes on his disciples, said: Happy are ye poor; for yours is the kingdom of God. ",selected_bible_verses
1881,Happy are ye that hunger now; for ye shall be filled. Happy are ye that weep now; for ye shall laugh.  ,selected_bible_verses
1882,"Happy are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from them, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the sake of the Son of man. ",selected_bible_verses
1883,"Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy; for, behold, your reward is great in heaven; for in the same manner did their fathers to the prophets.  ",selected_bible_verses
1884,But woe to you that are rich; for ye have received your consolation. ,selected_bible_verses
1885,Woe to you that are full; for ye shall hunger. Woe to you that laugh now; for ye shall mourn and weep. ,selected_bible_verses
1886,Woe! when all men shall speak well of you; for in the same manner did their fathers to the false prophets.  ,selected_bible_verses
1887,"But I say to you who hear: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, ",selected_bible_verses
1888,To him who smites thee on the cheek offer also the other; and him who takes away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also.  ,selected_bible_verses
1889,Give to every one that asks of thee; and of him who takes away thy goods demand them not again. ,selected_bible_verses
1890,"And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also in like manner to them.  ",selected_bible_verses
1891,"For if ye love those who love you, what thanks have ye? For even the sinners love those who love them. ",selected_bible_verses
1892,"And if ye do good to those who do good to you, what thanks have ye? For even the sinners do the same. ",selected_bible_verses
1893,"And if ye lend to those of whom ye hope to receive, what thanks have ye? And sinners lend to sinners, that they may receive as much in return.  ",selected_bible_verses
1894,"But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing in return; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be sons of the Highest; for he is kind to the unthankful and evil. ",selected_bible_verses

1898,And he spoke also a parable to them: Can the blind lead the blind? Shall they not both fall into the ditch? ,selected_bible_verses

1900,"And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye?  ",selected_bible_verses

Hypocrite! cast out first the beam out of thine eye, and then thou shalt see clearly to cast out the mote that is in thy brother's eye.  ",selected_bible_verses
1902,"For there is no good tree that bears corrupt fruit, nor corrupt tree that bears good fruit. ",selected_bible_verses

1906,"Every one that comes to me, and hears my sayings, and does them, I will show you to whom he is like. ",selected_bible_verses
1907,"He is like a man building a house, who digged deep, and laid a foundation on the rock. And when a flood arose, the stream burst upon that house, and could not shake it; because it was well builded. ",selected_bible_verses
1908,"And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear to him, was sick and about to die. ",selected_bible_verses
1909,"And having heard concerning Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, asking him that he would come and heal his servant. ",selected_bible_verses
1910,"And they, coming to Jesus, besought him earnestly, saying: He is worthy that thou shouldst do this for him; ",selected_bible_verses
1911,"for he loves our nation, and himself built our synagogue.  ",selected_bible_verses
1912,"And Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him: Lord, trouble not thyself; for I am not worthy that thou shouldst enter under my roof. ",selected_bible_verses
1913,"Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come to thee; but say with a word, and my servant will be healed. ",selected_bible_verses
1914,"For I am a man placed under authority, having soldiers under me, and I say to this one, Go, and he goes, and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it. ",selected_bible_verses
1915,"And Jesus hearing these things, marveled at him; and turning said to the multitude that followed him: I say to you, I found not so great faith, even in Israel.  ",selected_bible_verses
1916,"And they who were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.  ",selected_bible_verses
1917,"And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and a great multitude. ",selected_bible_verses
1918,"And as he came near to the gate of the city, behold, a dead man was carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow; and a great multitude of the city was with her. ",selected_bible_verses
1919,"And seeing her, the Lord had compassion on her, and said to her: Weep not. ",selected_bible_verses
1920,"And he came and touched the bier; and they who bore it stood still. And he said: Young man, I say to thee, arise. ",selected_bible_verses
1921,"And the dead sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother. ",selected_bible_verses
1922,"And fear seized on all; and they glorified God, saying: A great prophet has arisen among us; and, God has visited his people. ",selected_bible_verses
1923,"And this report went forth in all Judaea concerning him, and in all the country around.  ",selected_bible_verses
1924,And the disciples of John reported to him concerning all these things. ,selected_bible_verses
1925,"And John calling to him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus, saying: Art thou he that comes, or look we for another? ",selected_bible_verses
1926,"And coming to him, the men said: John the Immerser has sent us to thee, saying: Art thou he that comes, or look we for another? ",selected_bible_verses
1927,"And in that very hour he cured many, of diseases and plagues, and evil spirits; and on many blind he bestowed sight. ",selected_bible_verses
1928,"And answering he said to them: Go, and report to John what ye saw and heard; that the blind receive sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor good tidings are published. ",selected_bible_verses
1929,"And happy is he, whoever shall not be offended at me.  ",selected_bible_verses
1930,"And when the messengers of John had departed, he began to say to the multitudes concerning John: What went ye out into the wilderness to behold? A reed shaken by the wind?  ",selected_bible_verses
1931,"But what went ye out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they who are gorgeously appareled, and live delicately, are in kings' palaces.  ",selected_bible_verses
1932,"But what went ye out to see? A prophet? Yea, I say to you, and much more than a prophet. ",selected_bible_verses
1933,"This is he, of whom it is written:      Behold, I send forth my messenger before thy face,     Who shall prepare thy way before thee.  ",selected_bible_verses
1934,"For I say to you, among those born of women, no one is a greater prophet than John; but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.  ",selected_bible_verses
1935,"And all the people, hearing it, and the publicans, justified God, having been immersed with John's immersion. ",selected_bible_verses
1936,"But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God toward themselves, not having been immersed by him.  ",selected_bible_verses
1937,To what then shall I liken the men of this generation? And to what are they like? ,selected_bible_verses
1938,"They are like to children sitting in the market, and calling to one another, saying: We piped to you, and ye danced not; we sang the lament to you, and ye wept not. ",selected_bible_verses
1939,"For John the Immerser has come, neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say: He has a demon. ",selected_bible_verses
1940,"The Son of man has come eating and drinking; and ye say: Behold a glutton, and a wine-drinker, a friend of publicans and sinners. ",selected_bible_verses
1941,But wisdom was justified on the part of all her children.  ,selected_bible_verses
1942,"And one of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him. And entering into the house of the Pharisee, he reclined at table. ",selected_bible_verses
1943,"And, behold, a woman who was a sinner in the city, learning that he is reclining at table in the house of the Pharisee, brought an alabaster box of ointment; ",selected_bible_verses
1944,"and standing behind at his feet weeping, began to wet his feet with tears, and wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.  ",selected_bible_verses
1945,"And seeing it, the Pharisee who had bidden him spoke within himself, saying: This man, if he were a prophet, would know who and what sort of woman this is that touches him; for she is a sinner. ",selected_bible_verses
1946,"And Jesus answering said to him: Simon, I have somewhat to say to thee. And he says: Teacher, say on. ",selected_bible_verses
1947,"And they having nothing to pay, he forgave them both. Which of them therefore, tell me, will love him most? ",selected_bible_verses
1948,Simon answering said: I suppose he to whom he forgave most. And he said to him: Thou didst rightly judge. ,selected_bible_verses
1949,"And turning to the woman, he said to Simon: Seest thou this woman? I entered into thy house, thou gayest me no water for my feet; but she has wet my feet with tears, and wiped them with her hair. ",selected_bible_verses
1950,"Thou gavest me no kiss; but she, from the time I came in, ceased not to kiss my feet. ",selected_bible_verses
1951,My head with oil thou didst not anoint; but she anointed my feet with ointment. ,selected_bible_verses
1952,"Wherefore I say to thee, her many sins are forgiven; for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little. ",selected_bible_verses
1953,And he said to her: Thy sins are forgiven. ,selected_bible_verses
1954,And they who reclined with him began to say within themselves: Who is this that also forgives sins? ,selected_bible_verses
1955,"And he said to the woman: Thy faith has saved thee; go in peace.    VIII.  AND it came to pass afterward, that he journeyed through every city and village, preaching, and publishing the good news of the kingdom of God; and with him the twelve, ",selected_bible_verses
1956,"and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called the Magdalene, from whom had gone out seven demons, ",selected_bible_verses
1957,"and Joanna wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, who ministered to them of their substance.  ",selected_bible_verses
1958,"And a great multitude coming together, of those also who came to him out of every city, he spoke by a parable: ",selected_bible_verses
1959,"The sower went forth to sow his seed. And as he sowed, one fell by the way-side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it. ",selected_bible_verses
1960,"And another fell upon the rock; and springing up, it withered away, because it had no moisture. ",selected_bible_verses
1961,"And another fell among the thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it. ",selected_bible_verses
1962,"And another fell into the good ground, and sprang up, and bore fruit a hundredfold.  And saying these things, he cried: He that has ears to hear, let him hear.  ",selected_bible_verses
1963,"And his disciples asked him, what this parable was. ",selected_bible_verses
1964,"And he said: To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God; but to the rest in parables, that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.  ",selected_bible_verses
1965,Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God. ,selected_bible_verses
1966,"Those by the way-side are they that hear; after that comes the Devil, and takes away the word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved. ",selected_bible_verses
1967,"Those on the rock are they who, when they hear, with joy receive the word; and these have no root, who for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away. ",selected_bible_verses
1968,"And that which fell among the thorns, these are they who have heard, and going forth are choked with the cares and riches and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to perfection. ",selected_bible_verses
1969,"But that in the good ground, these are they who, in an honest and good heart, having heard, hold fast the word, and bring forth fruit with patience.  ",selected_bible_verses
1970,"No one, having lighted a lamp, covers it with a vessel, or puts it under a bed; but puts it on a lamp-stand, that they who enter in may behold the light. ",selected_bible_verses
1971,"For nothing is secret that shall not be made manifest, nor hidden, that shall not be known and come abroad. ",selected_bible_verses
1972,"Take heed therefore how ye hear. For whoever has, to him shall be given; and whoever has not, even what he seems to have shall be taken from him.  ",selected_bible_verses
1973,And his mother and his brothers came to him; and they could not come near him on account of the multitude. ,selected_bible_verses
1974,"And it was told him, saying: Thy mother and thy brothers are standing without, desiring to see thee. ",selected_bible_verses
1975,"And he answering, said to them: My mother and my brothers are these, who hear and do the word of God.  ",selected_bible_verses
1976,"And it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples. And he said to them: Let us go over to the other side of the lake. And they launched forth. ",selected_bible_verses
1977,"And as they were sailing, he fell asleep. And there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they began to be filled, and were in jeopardy. ",selected_bible_verses
1978,"And coming to him, they awoke him, saying: Master, Master, we perish. And he, rising, rebuked the wind and the raging of the water; and they ceased, and there was a calm. ",selected_bible_verses
1979,"And he said to them: Where is your faith? And they, fearing, wondered; saying one to another: Who then is this, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him!  ",selected_bible_verses
1980,"And they sailed to the country of the Gerasenes, which is over against Galilee. ",selected_bible_verses
1981,"And when he had gone forth upon the land, there met him a certain man out of the city, who had demons a long time, and wore no clothing, and abode not in a house, but in the tombs. ",selected_bible_verses
1982,"And seeing Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said: What have I to do with thee, Jesus, Son of the most high God? I beseech thee, do not torment me. ",selected_bible_verses
1983,"For he commanded the unclean spirit to come out from the man. For of a long time it had seized him, and he was bound, being secured with chains and fetters; and bursting the bands, he was driven by the demon into the deserts.  ",selected_bible_verses
1984,"And Jesus asked him, saying: What is thy name? And he said, Legion; because many demons had entered into him. ",selected_bible_verses
1985,And he besought him that he would not command them to go away into the abyss. ,selected_bible_verses
1986,And there was a herd of many swine feeding in the mountain; and they besought him that he would permit them to enter into them. And he permitted them. ,selected_bible_verses
1987,"And going out of the man, the demons entered into the swine; and the herd rushed down the steep into the lake, and were choked. ",selected_bible_verses
1988,"And seeing what was done the herdsmen fled, and reported it in the city and in the country, ",selected_bible_verses
1989,"And they went out to see what was done. And they came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. ",selected_bible_verses
1990,They also who saw it reported to them how he that was possessed by demons was healed. ,selected_bible_verses
1991,"And the whole multitude of the surrounding country of the Gerasenes besought him to depart from them; for they were seized with great fear.  And he, entering into the ship, returned. ",selected_bible_verses
1992,"And the man, out of whom the demons had gone, besought him that he might be with him. But he sent him away, saying: ",selected_bible_verses
1993,"Return into thy house, and relate how great things God did for thee. And he departed, and published through the whole city how great things Jesus did for him.  ",selected_bible_verses
1994,"And it came to pass, when Jesus returned, that the multitude received him; for they were all waiting for him. ",selected_bible_verses
1995,"And, behold, there came a man whose name was Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue; and falling at the feet of Jesus, he besought him that he would come into his house; ",selected_bible_verses
1996,"for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. And as he went the multitudes thronged him.  ",selected_bible_verses
1997,"And a woman having a flow of blood twelve years, who had spent all her living on physicians, and could not be healed by any one, ",selected_bible_verses
1998,"came up behind, and touched the fringe of his garment; and immediately her flow of blood ceased. ",selected_bible_verses
1999,"And Jesus said: Who is it that touched me? And when all denied it, Peter and those with him said: Master, the multitudes throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou: Who is it that touched me? ",selected_bible_verses
2000,And Jesus said: Some one touched me; for I perceived that power has gone out from me.  ,selected_bible_verses
2001,"And the woman, seeing that she was not concealed, came trembling, and falling down before him, declared before all the people for what cause she touched him, and how she was healed immediately. ",selected_bible_verses
2002,"And he said to her: Daughter, thy faith has made thee whole; go in peace.  ",selected_bible_verses
2003,"While he was yet speaking, there comes one from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying to him: Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Teacher. ",selected_bible_verses
2004,"But Jesus hearing it, answered him: Fear not; only believe, and she shall be restored.  ",selected_bible_verses
2005,"And entering into the house, he suffered no one to go in with him, save Peter and James and John, and the father of the maiden, and the mother. ",selected_bible_verses
2006,"And all were weeping and bewailing her. And he said: Weep not; she is not dead, but is sleeping. ",selected_bible_verses
2007,"And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead. ",selected_bible_verses
2008,"And he, taking hold of her by the hand, called, saying: Maiden, arise. ",selected_bible_verses
2009,"And her spirit returned, and she immediately arose; and he commanded that food should be given her. ",selected_bible_verses
2010,"And her parents were astonished. But he charged them to tell no one what was done.    IX.  AND having called the twelve together, he gave them power and authority over all the demons, and to cure diseases. ",selected_bible_verses
2011,"And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick. ",selected_bible_verses
2012,"And he said to them: Take nothing for the journey, neither staff, nor bag, nor bread, nor money, nor have two coats apiece. ",selected_bible_verses
2013,"And into whatever house ye enter, there abide, and thence depart. ",selected_bible_verses
2014,"And whoever will not receive you, when ye go out from that city, shake off even the dust from your feet for a testimony against them.  ",selected_bible_verses
2015,"And going forth, they went through the villages, publishing the good news, and healing everywhere.  ",selected_bible_verses
2016,"And Herod the tetrarch heard of all the things that were done. And he was perplexed, because it was said by some: John has risen from the dead; ",selected_bible_verses
2017,and by some: Elijah has appeared; and by others: One of the old prophets has risen again. ,selected_bible_verses
2018,"And Herod said: John I beheaded; but who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him.  ",selected_bible_verses
2019,"And the apostles, returning, related to him all that they did. And taking them with him, he retired privately to a city called Bethsaida. ",selected_bible_verses
2020,"And the multitudes, when they knew it, followed him. And receiving them, he spoke to them concerning the kingdom of God, and healed those who had need of healing.  ",selected_bible_verses
2021,"And the day began to decline. And the twelve came, and said to him: Dismiss the multitude, that they may go into the villages around, and the fields, and lodge, and find food; for here we are in a desert place. ",selected_bible_verses
2022,And he said to them: Do ye give them to eat. And they said: We have not more than five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy food for all this people. ,selected_bible_verses
2023,For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples: Make them lie down in companies of fifty. ,selected_bible_verses
2024,"And they did so, and made them all lie down. ",selected_bible_verses
2025,"And taking the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven and blessed them, and broke, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude. ",selected_bible_verses
2026,"And they ate, and were all filled. And there were taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets.  ",selected_bible_verses
2027,"And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, that his disciples were with him; and he asked them, saying: Who do the multitudes say that I am? ",selected_bible_verses
2028,"They answering said: John the Immerser; and others, Elijah; and others, that one of the old prophets has risen again. ",selected_bible_verses
2029,And he said to them: But who do ye say that I am? Peter answering said: The Christ of God. ,selected_bible_verses
2030,"And strictly charging them, he commanded them to say this to no one; ",selected_bible_verses
2031,"saying: The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected on the part of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and rise on the third day.  ",selected_bible_verses
2032,"And he said to all: If any one will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me. ",selected_bible_verses
2033,"For whoever will save his life shall lose it; and whoever may lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it ",selected_bible_verses
2034,"For what is a man profited, when he has gained the whole world, and lost or forfeited himself? ",selected_bible_verses
2035,"For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his glory, and in that of the Father and of the holy angels. ",selected_bible_verses
2036,"And I say to you of a truth, there are some of those standing here, who shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.  ",selected_bible_verses
2037,"And it came to pass, about eight days after these sayings, that he took with him Peter and John and James, and went up into the mountain to pray. ",selected_bible_verses
2038,"And it came to pass, while he was praying, that the appearance of his countenance became changed, and his raiment white and glistening. ",selected_bible_verses
2039,"And, behold, two men were talking with him, who were Moses and Elijah; ",selected_bible_verses
2040,"who appeared in glory, and spoke of his departure, which he was about to fulfill in Jerusalem.  ",selected_bible_verses
2041,"But Peter and they who were with him were heavy with sleep; and awaking, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him. ",selected_bible_verses
2042,"And it came to pass, that, as they were departing from him, Peter said to Jesus: Master, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tents, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah; not knowing what he said. ",selected_bible_verses
2043,"While he said this, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them; and they feared as they entered into the cloud. ",selected_bible_verses
2044,"And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying: This is my chosen Son; hear ye him.  ",selected_bible_verses
2045,"And when the voice had come, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent, and told no one in those days any of the things which they had seen.  ",selected_bible_verses
2046,"And it came to pass, on the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, that a great multitude met him. ",selected_bible_verses
2047,"And, behold, a man from the multitude cried, saying: Teacher, I beseech thee, look upon my son; for he is my only child. ",selected_bible_verses
2048,"And, behold, a spirit takes him, and he suddenly cries out; and it tears him with foaming, and hardly departs from him, bruising him. ",selected_bible_verses
2049,And I entreated thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not.  ,selected_bible_verses
2050,"And Jesus answering said: O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and bear with you? Bring hither thy son. ",selected_bible_verses
2051,"And while he was yet coming, the demon threw him down, and tore him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and gave him back to his father. ",selected_bible_verses
2052,"And all were amazed at the mighty power of God.  But while all were wondering at all things which Jesus did, he said to his disciples: ",selected_bible_verses
2053,"Do ye let these words sink into your ears, for the Son of man will be delivered into the hands of men. ",selected_bible_verses
2054,"But they understood not this saying, and it was hidden from them, that they perceived it not; and they feared to ask him concerning that saying.  ",selected_bible_verses
2055,"And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child and placed it by him, ",selected_bible_verses
2056,"and said to them: Whoever shall receive this child in my name, receives me; and whoever shall receive me, receives him who sent me; for he that is least among you all, the same is great.  ",selected_bible_verses
2057,"And John answering said: Master, we saw one casting out demons in thy name; and we forbade him, because he follows not with us. ",selected_bible_verses
2058,And Jesus said to him: Forbid him not; for he that is not against us is for us.  ,selected_bible_verses
2059,"And it came to pass, when the days were being completed that he should be received up, he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem. ",selected_bible_verses
2060,"And he sent messengers before his face; and they went and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him. ",selected_bible_verses
2061,"And they did not receive him, because his face was directed toward Jerusalem. ",selected_bible_verses
2062,"And his disciples, James and John, seeing it, said: Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, as also Elijah did? ",selected_bible_verses
2063,And they went to another village.  ,selected_bible_verses
2064,"And as they were going in the way, a certain one said to him: I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest. ",selected_bible_verses
2065,"And Jesus said to him: The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man has not where to lay his head.  ",selected_bible_verses
2066,And he said to another: Follow me. But he said: Lord permit me first to go and bury my father. ,selected_bible_verses
2067,And he said to him: Let the dead bury their own dead; but do thou go and announce the kingdom of God.  ,selected_bible_verses
2068,"And another also said; I will follow thee, Lord; but first permit me to bid farewell to those in my house. ",selected_bible_verses
2069,"And Jesus said to him: No one, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.    X.  AFTER these things the Lord appointed also seventy others, and sent them two and two before his face, into every city and place, whither he himself was about to come. ",selected_bible_verses
2070,"And he said to them: The harvest indeed is great, but the laborers are few. Pray therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth laborers into his harvest. ",selected_bible_verses
2071,"Go your ways; behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves. ",selected_bible_verses
2072,"Carry neither purse, nor bag, nor sandals; and salute no one by the way. ",selected_bible_verses
2073,"And into whatever house ye enter, first say: Peace be to this house. ",selected_bible_verses
2074,"And if a son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it; and if not, it shall return to you. ",selected_bible_verses
2075,"And into whatever city ye enter and they receive you, eat what is set before you; ",selected_bible_verses
2076,"and heal the sick that are therein, and say to them: The kingdom of God has come nigh unto you. ",selected_bible_verses
2077,"But into whatever city ye enter and they receive you not, go out into the streets of the same, and say: ",selected_bible_verses
2078,"I say to you, that it will be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.  ",selected_bible_verses
2079,"Woe to thee, Chorazin! Woe to thee, Bethsaida! For if the miracles had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which were done in you, they would long ago have repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. ",selected_bible_verses
2080,"But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment, than for you. ",selected_bible_verses
2081,"And thou, Capernaum, that art exalted to heaven, shalt be brought down to the underworld.  ",selected_bible_verses
2082,"He that hears you, hears me; and he that rejects you, rejects me; and he that rejects me, rejects him who sent me.  ",selected_bible_verses
2083,"And the seventy returned with joy, saying: Lord, even the demons are subjected to us in thy name. ",selected_bible_verses
2084,And he said to them: I beheld Satan fall as lightning from heaven. ,selected_bible_verses
2085,"Behold, I have given you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing shall hurt you. ",selected_bible_verses
2086,"But yet, rejoice not in this, that the spirits are subjected to you; but rejoice, that your names are written in heaven.  ",selected_bible_verses
2087,"In that hour he rejoiced in spirit, and said: I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou didst hide these things from the wise and discerning, and reveal them to babes; yea, O Father, that so it seemed good in thy sight. ",selected_bible_verses
2088,"All things were delivered to me by my Father; and no one knows who the Son is but the Father, and who the Father is but the Son, and he to whom the Son is pleased to reveal him.  ",selected_bible_verses
2089,"And turning to the disciples, he said privately: Happy are the eyes that behold what ye are beholding. ",selected_bible_verses
2090,"For I say to you, that many prophets and kings desired to see what ye are beholding, and saw not, and to hear what ye are hearing, and heard not.  ",selected_bible_verses
2091,"And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, tempting him, saying: Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? ",selected_bible_verses
2092,He said to him: What is written in the law? How readest thou? ,selected_bible_verses
2093,"And he answering said: Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself. ",selected_bible_verses
2094,"And he said to him: Thou answeredst rightly. This do, and thou shalt live. ",selected_bible_verses
2095,"But he, desiring to justify himself, said to Jesus: Who then is my neighbor?  ",selected_bible_verses
2096,"And Jesus answering said: A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among robbers, who stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead. ",selected_bible_verses
2097,"And by chance a certain priest was going down that way; and seeing him, he passed by on the other side. ",selected_bible_verses
2098,"And in like manner also a Levite, arriving at the place, came and saw, and passed by on the other side.  ",selected_bible_verses
2099,"And a certain Samaritan, as he was journeying, came where he was, and seeing him had compassion; ",selected_bible_verses
2100,"and coming to him, bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine; and setting him on his own beast, he brought him to an inn, and took care of him. ",selected_bible_verses
2101,"Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbor to him that fell among the robbers? ",selected_bible_verses
2102,"And he said: He that had mercy on him. And Jesus said to him: Go, and do thou likewise.  ",selected_bible_verses
2103,"And it came to pass, as they were going, that he entered into a certain village; and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house. ",selected_bible_verses
2104,"And she had a sister called Mary, who also sat at the feet of Jesus, and heard his word. ",selected_bible_verses
2105,"But Martha was encumbered with much serving; and she came to him, and said: Lord, dost thou not care that my sister left me to serve alone? Bid her therefore that she help me. ",selected_bible_verses
2106,"And Jesus answering said to her: Martha, Martha, thou art anxious and troubled about many things. ",selected_bible_verses
2107,"But one thing is needful; and Mary chose the good part, which shall not be taken away from her.    XI.  AND it came to pass that, as he was in a certain place praying, when he ceased, one of his disciples said to him: Lord, teach us to pray, as also John taught his disciples. ",selected_bible_verses
2108,"And he said to them: When ye pray, say; Father, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. ",selected_bible_verses
2109,And forgive us our sins; for we ourselves forgive every one indebted to us. And bring us not into temptation.  ,selected_bible_verses
2110,"And he said to them: Who of you shall have a friend, and shall go to him at midnight, and say to him: ",selected_bible_verses
2111,"Friend, lend me three loaves; for a friend of mine is come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him; ",selected_bible_verses
2112,"and he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not; the door is already shut, and my children with me are in bed; I can not rise and give thee? ",selected_bible_verses
2113,"I say to you, though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needs. ",selected_bible_verses
2114,"I also say to you: Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you. ",selected_bible_verses
2115,For every one that asks receives; and he that seeks finds; and to him that knocks it shall be opened.  ,selected_bible_verses
2116,"And what father is there among you, of whom if his son ask bread, he will give him a stone; or a fish, will instead of a fish give him a serpent? ",selected_bible_verses

2118,"If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?  ",selected_bible_verses
2119,"And he was casting out a demon, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the demon was gone out, that the dumb man spoke; and the multitudes wondered. ",selected_bible_verses
2120,"But some of them said: He casts out the demons through Beelzebul, the prince of the demons. ",selected_bible_verses
2121,"And others, tempting, sought of him a sign from heaven. ",selected_bible_verses
2122,"And if Satan also is divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out the demons through Beelzebul. ",selected_bible_verses
2123,"And if I through Beelzebul cast out the demons, through whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges. ",selected_bible_verses

2125,"When a strong man armed keeps his palace, his goods are in peace. ",selected_bible_verses

2130,"Then he goes, and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there; and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first.  ",selected_bible_verses
2131,"And it came to pass, as he was saying these things, that a certain woman lifting up her voice from the multitude, said to him: Happy the womb that bore thee, and breasts which thou didst suck! ",selected_bible_verses

2133,"And the multitudes gathering more and more, he began to say: This generation is an evil generation. It seeks a sign; and no sign shall be given it, but the sign of Jonah. ",selected_bible_verses

IN the mean time, the multitude having gathered together in tens of thousands, so that they trod one upon another, he began first to say to his disciples: Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. ",selected_bible_verses
2155,"For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed, nor hidden, that shall not be known. ",selected_bible_verses

2311,"And the master commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely; because the sons of this world are, in their generation, wiser than the sons of light. ",selected_bible_verses

2327,"And he cried and said: Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame. ",selected_bible_verses

2329,"And besides all this, between us and you a great gulf is fixed; that they who would pass from hence to you may not be able, nor those from thence pass over to us. ",selected_bible_verses
2330,"And he said: I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldst send him to my father's house. ",selected_bible_verses

2346,"And they lifted up their voice, saying: Jesus, Master, have mercy on us. ",selected_bible_verses

2348,"And one of them, seeing that he was healed, turned back, with a loud voice glorifying God, ",selected_bible_verses
2349,"and fell down on his face at his feet, giving thanks to him; and he was a Samaritan. ",selected_bible_verses
2350,And Jesus answering said: Were not the ten cleansed? And where are the nine? ,selected_bible_verses

2368,"And they answering say to him: Where, Lord? And he said to them: Where the body is, there also will the eagles be gathered together.    XVIII.  AND he spoke also a parable to them, to the end that they ought always to pray, and not to faint; ",selected_bible_verses
2369,"saying: There was in a certain city a certain judge, who feared not God, nor regarded man. ",selected_bible_verses
2370,"And there was a widow in that city; and she came to him, saying: Avenge me of my adversary. ",selected_bible_verses
2371,"And he would not for a while; but afterward he said within himself: Though I fear not God, nor regard man, ",selected_bible_verses
2372,"yet because this widow troubles me, I will avenge her, lest continually coming she weary me.  ",selected_bible_verses
2373,And the Lord said: Hear what the unjust judge says. ,selected_bible_verses
2374,"And will not God avenge his chosen, who cry to him day and night, though he is long suffering in respect to them? ",selected_bible_verses
2375,"I say to you, that he will avenge them speedily. But yet, when the Son of man comes, will he find faith on the earth?  ",selected_bible_verses
2376,"And he spoke this parable to some who trust in themselves that they are righteous, and despise others. ",selected_bible_verses
2377,"Two men went up into the temple to pray; one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. ",selected_bible_verses
2378,"The Pharisee stood, and prayed thus with himself: God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. ",selected_bible_verses
2379,"And the publican, standing afar off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying: God be merciful to me, the sinner. ",selected_bible_verses
2380,"I say to you, this man went down to his house justified, rather than the other. For every one that exalts himself shall be humbled; and he that humbles himself shall be exalted.  ",selected_bible_verses
2381,"And they brought to him also infants, that he might touch them; and the disciples seeing it rebuked them. ",selected_bible_verses
2382,"But Jesus calling them to him, said: Suffer the little children to come to me, and forbid them not; for to such belongs the kingdom of God. ",selected_bible_verses
2383,"Verily I say to you, whoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, shall not enter therein.  ",selected_bible_verses
2384,"And a certain ruler asked him, saying: Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? ",selected_bible_verses
2385,"And Jesus said to him: Why dost thou call me good? None is good save one, God. ",selected_bible_verses
2386,"Thou knowest the commandments: Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor thy father and thy mother. ",selected_bible_verses
2387,And he said: All these I kept from my youth. ,selected_bible_verses
2388,"And Jesus hearing it said to him: Yet lackest thou one thing; sell all that thou hast, and distribute to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me. ",selected_bible_verses
2389,"And hearing this, he became very sorrowful; for he was exceedingly rich. ",selected_bible_verses
2390,"And Jesus seeing him became very sorrowful, said: How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God! ",selected_bible_verses
2391,"For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. ",selected_bible_verses
2392,And they who heard it said: And who can be saved? ,selected_bible_verses
2393,And he said: The things that are impossible with men are possible with God.  ,selected_bible_verses
2394,"And Peter said: Lo, we forsook all, and followed thee. ",selected_bible_verses
2395,"And he said to them: Verily I say to you, there is no one that forsook house, or parents, or brothers, or wife, or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God, ",selected_bible_verses
2396,"who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.  ",selected_bible_verses
2397,"And taking with him the twelve, he said to them: Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all the things written by the prophets for the Son of man shall be accomplished. ",selected_bible_verses
2398,"For he will be delivered to the Gentiles, and will be mocked, and insulted, and spit upon, ",selected_bible_verses
2399,"and they will scourge him, and put him to death; and on the third day he will rise again. ",selected_bible_verses
2400,"And they understood none of these things; and this saying was hidden from them, and they knew not the things that were said.  ",selected_bible_verses
2401,"And it came to pass, that as he came near to Jericho, a certain blind man was sitting by the way-side, begging. ",selected_bible_verses
2402,"And hearing a multitude passing by, he inquired what this was. ",selected_bible_verses
2403,"And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth is passing by. ",selected_bible_verses
2404,"And he called aloud, saying: Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me. ",selected_bible_verses
2405,"And they who went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace. But he cried much the more: Son of David, have mercy on me. ",selected_bible_verses
2406,"And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be brought to him. And when he was come near, he asked him, ",selected_bible_verses
2407,"saying: What wilt thou that I shall do to thee? And he said: Lord, that I may receive sight. ",selected_bible_verses
2408,And Jesus said to him: Receive sight; thy faith has made thee whole. ,selected_bible_verses
2409,"And immediately he received sight, and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people, seeing it, gave praise to God.    XIX.  AND having entered in, he was passing through Jericho. ",selected_bible_verses
2410,"And behold, there was a man named Zaccheus, and he was a chief publican; and this man was rich. ",selected_bible_verses
2411,"And he sought to see Jesus, who he was; and he could not on account of the multitude, because he was small in stature. ",selected_bible_verses
2412,"And running before, he climbed up into a sycamore-tree to see him; because by that way he was to pass through. ",selected_bible_verses
2413,"And Jesus, when he came to the place, looked up and saw him, and said to him: Zaccheus, make haste and come down; for to-day I must abide at thy house. ",selected_bible_verses
2414,"And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully. ",selected_bible_verses
2415,"And seeing it, they all murmured, saying that he went in to be a guest with a sinner.  ",selected_bible_verses
2416,"And Zaccheus stood up, and said to the Lord: Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I took aught from any one by false accusation, I restore fourfold. ",selected_bible_verses
2417,"And Jesus said to him: This day is salvation come to this house, inasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham. ",selected_bible_verses
2418,For the Son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost.  ,selected_bible_verses
2419,"And as they were hearing these things, he added and spoke a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God would immediately appear. ",selected_bible_verses
2420,"He said therefore: A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return. ",selected_bible_verses
2421,"And having called his ten servants, he gave them ten pounds, and said to them: Traffic, till I come.  ",selected_bible_verses
2422,"But his citizens hated him, and sent an embassy after him, saying: We will not have this man to reign over us.  ",selected_bible_verses
2423,"And it came to pass, when he had returned, having received the kingdom, that he commanded these servants to be called to him, to whom he gave the money, that he might know what each gained by trading. ",selected_bible_verses
2424,"And the first came, saying: Lord, thy pound gained ten pounds. ",selected_bible_verses
2425,"And he said to him: Well done, good servant; because thou wast faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities.  ",selected_bible_verses
2426,"And the second came, saying: Lord, thy pound made five pounds. ",selected_bible_verses
2427,And he said also to this man: And be thou over five cities. ,selected_bible_verses
2428,"And another came, saying: Lord, behold thy pound, which I kept laid up in a napkin. ",selected_bible_verses
2429,"For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man; thou takest up what thou layedst not down, and reapest what thou didst not sow. ",selected_bible_verses
2430,"And he says to him: Out of thy mouth will I judge thee, wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up what I laid not down, and reaping what I did not sow? ",selected_bible_verses
2431,"Why then didst thou not put my money into the bank? and I, at my coming, should have required it with interest. ",selected_bible_verses
2432,"And he said to those standing by: Take from him the pound, and give it to him that has the ten pounds. ",selected_bible_verses
2433,"And they said to him: Lord, he has ten pounds. ",selected_bible_verses
2434,"For I say to you, that to every one that has shall be given; and from him that has not, even what he has shall be taken away.  ",selected_bible_verses
2435,"But those my enemies, who would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.  ",selected_bible_verses
2436,"And having spoken these things, he went before, going up to Jerusalem. ",selected_bible_verses
2437,"And it came to pass, as he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called Olivet, that he sent forth two of his disciples, ",selected_bible_verses
2438,"saying: Go into the opposite village, in which as ye are entering ye will find a colt tied, whereon no man ever sat; loose and bring him. ",selected_bible_verses
2439,"And if any one ask you, why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say to him: Because the Lord has need of him. ",selected_bible_verses
2440,"And they that were sent forth departed, and found even as he said to them. ",selected_bible_verses
2441,"And as they were loosing the colt, its owners said to them: Why loose ye the colt? ",selected_bible_verses
2442,And they said: The Lord has need of him. ,selected_bible_verses
2443,"And they brought him to Jesus; and having cast their garments upon the colt, they set Jesus thereon. ",selected_bible_verses
2444,"And as he went, they spread their garments in the way. ",selected_bible_verses
2445,"And as he was drawing near, just at the descent of the mount of the Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice, and praise God with a loud voice for all the miracles which they saw; ",selected_bible_verses
2446,"saying: Blessed be the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest!  ",selected_bible_verses
2447,"And some of the Pharisees from the multitude said to him: Teacher, rebuke thy disciples. ",selected_bible_verses
2448,"And answering he said to them: I tell you that if these shall hold their peace, the stones will cry out.  ",selected_bible_verses
2449,"And when he came near, as he saw the city, he wept over it, ",selected_bible_verses
2450,"saying: If even thou hadst known, at least in this thy day, the things that belong to thy peace! But now they are hidden from thine eyes. ",selected_bible_verses
2451,"For days will come upon thee, that thine enemies will cast up a mound about thee, and compass thee round, and shut thee in on every side, ",selected_bible_verses
2452,"and will level thee with the ground, and thy children within thee, and will not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.  ",selected_bible_verses
2453,"And entering into the temple, he began to cast out those who sold; ",selected_bible_verses
2454,"saying to them: It is written, And my house shall be a house of prayer; but ye made it a den of robbers.  ",selected_bible_verses
2455,"And he was teaching daily in the temple; and the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people were seeking to destroy him, ",selected_bible_verses
2456,"and could not find what they might do; for all the people hung, listening, upon him.    XX.  AND it came to pass, on one of the days, as he was teaching the people in the temple, and publishing the good news, that the chief priests and the scribes came to him with the elders, ",selected_bible_verses
2457,"and spoke to him, saying: Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? Or who is he that gave thee this authority? ",selected_bible_verses
2458,And he answering said to them: I also will ask you one thing; and tell it me. ,selected_bible_verses
2459,"John's immersion, was it from heaven, or from men? ",selected_bible_verses
2460,"And they reasoned with themselves, saying: If we say, From heaven, he will say, Why, then did ye not believe him? ",selected_bible_verses
2461,"But if we say, From men, all the people will stone us; for they are persuaded that John was a prophet. ",selected_bible_verses
2462,"And they answered, that they knew not whence it was. ",selected_bible_verses
2463,"And Jesus said to them: Neither do I say to you, by what authority I do these things.  ",selected_bible_verses
2464,"And he began to speak to the people this parable: A man planted a vineyard, and let it out to husbandmen, and went abroad for a long time. ",selected_bible_verses
2465,"And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard; but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty. ",selected_bible_verses
2466,"And again he sent another servant; and him also, having beaten and treated him shamefully, they sent away empty. ",selected_bible_verses
2467,"And again he sent a third; and they wounded him also, and cast him out.  ",selected_bible_verses
2468,"And the lord of the vineyard said: What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps, seeing him, they will reverence him. ",selected_bible_verses
2469,"But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying: This is the heir; come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may become ours. ",selected_bible_verses
2470,"So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them? ",selected_bible_verses
2471,"He will come and destroy these husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others. And hearing it, they said: Far be it! ",selected_bible_verses
2472,"And he, looking on them, said: What then is this that is written,      The stone which the builders disallowed,     The same is become the head of the corner.  ",selected_bible_verses
2473,"Every one that falls upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.  ",selected_bible_verses
2474,And the scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him in that hour; and they feared the people; for they knew that he spoke this parable against them.  ,selected_bible_verses
2475,"And they asked him, saying: Teacher, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, and regardest not the person of any, but teachest the way of God truly. ",selected_bible_verses
2476,"Is it lawful that we should give tribute to Caesar, or not? ",selected_bible_verses
2477,"And perceiving their craftiness, he said to them: ",selected_bible_verses
2478,"And he said to them: Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. ",selected_bible_verses
2479,"And they could not take hold of his words before the people; and they marveled at his answer, and held their peace.  ",selected_bible_verses
2480,"And some of the Sadducees, who deny that there is a resurrection, coming to him, asked him, ",selected_bible_verses
2481,"saying: Teacher, Moses wrote to us, if a man's brother die, having a wife, and he die childless, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.  ",selected_bible_verses
2482,"There were therefore seven brothers; and the first took a wife, and died childless; ",selected_bible_verses
2483,and the second and the third took her; ,selected_bible_verses
2484,"and in like manner also the seven left no children, and died. ",selected_bible_verses
2485,At last the woman also died. ,selected_bible_verses
2486,"In the resurrection, therefore, of which of them is she wife? For the seven had her for a wife.  ",selected_bible_verses
2487,"And Jesus answering said to them: The sons of this world marry, and are given in marriage. ",selected_bible_verses
2488,"But they who are accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage; ",selected_bible_verses
2489,"for neither can they die any more; for they are equal to the angels, and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.  ",selected_bible_verses
2490,"Now that the dead are raised, even Moses showed, at The Bush, when he calls the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. ",selected_bible_verses
2491,"For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living; for to him all live.  ",selected_bible_verses
2492,"And some of the scribes answering said: Teacher, thou saidst well. ",selected_bible_verses
2493,For they no longer dared to ask him any question.  ,selected_bible_verses
2494,And he said to them: How say they that the Christ is son of David? ,selected_bible_verses
2495,"And David himself says in the book of Psalms:      The LORD said to my Lord,     Sit on my right hand,     ",selected_bible_verses
2496,Till I make thine enemies thy footstool.  ,selected_bible_verses
2497,"David therefore calls him Lord, and how is he his son?  ",selected_bible_verses
2498,"And in the hearing of all the multitude, he said to his disciples: ",selected_bible_verses
2499,"Beware of the scribes, who desire to go about in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the first seats in the synagogues, and the first places at feasts; ",selected_bible_verses
2500,"who devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. These shall receive greater condemnation.    XXI.  AND looking up, he saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury. ",selected_bible_verses
2501,And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites. ,selected_bible_verses
2502,"And he said: Of a truth I say to you, that this poor widow cast in more than all. ",selected_bible_verses
2503,"For all these, out of their abundance, cast into the offerings; but she, out of her want, cast in all the living that she had.  ",selected_bible_verses
2504,"And as some were saying of the temple, that it has been adorned with beautiful stones and offerings, he said: ",selected_bible_verses
2505,"As for these things which ye behold, days will come in which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down. ",selected_bible_verses
2506,"And they asked him, saying: Teacher, when therefore will these things be, and what will be the sign when these things are about to come to pass?  ",selected_bible_verses
2507,"And he said: Take heed that ye be not led astray. For many will come in my name, saying: I am he, and the time is at hand. Go not after them. ",selected_bible_verses
2508,"And when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified; for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not immediately.  ",selected_bible_verses
2509,"Then said he to them: Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; ",selected_bible_verses
2510,"and there will be great earthquakes, and in divers places famines and pestilences; and there will be great portents and signs from heaven. ",selected_bible_verses
2511,"And before all these, they will lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up into synagogues and prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake. ",selected_bible_verses
2512,And it shall turn out to you for a testimony.  ,selected_bible_verses
2513,"Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye shall answer. ",selected_bible_verses
2514,"For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay or withstand. ",selected_bible_verses
2515,"And ye will be delivered up both by parents, and brothers, and kindred, and friends; and some of you they will cause to be put to death. ",selected_bible_verses
2516,And ye will be hated by all for my name's sake. ,selected_bible_verses
2517,And there shall not a hair of your head perish. ,selected_bible_verses
2518,"And when ye shall see Jerusalem encompassed by armies, then know that its desolation is at hand. ",selected_bible_verses
2519,Then let those in Judaea flee into the mountains; and let those in the midst of it depart out; and let those in the fields not enter into it. ,selected_bible_verses
2520,"Because these are the days of vengeance, that all the things which are written may be fulfilled.  ",selected_bible_verses
2521,"Woe to those who are with child, and to those who give suck, in those days! For there shall be great distress upon the land, and wrath to this people. ",selected_bible_verses
2522,"And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all the nations; and Jerusalem shall be trodden down by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles shall be fulfilled.  ",selected_bible_verses
2523,"And there shall be signs in the sun, and moon, and stars; and on the earth distress of nations, in perplexity for the roaring of the sea and waves; ",selected_bible_verses
2524,"men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking for those things that are coming on the world; for the powers of heaven shall be shaken. ",selected_bible_verses
2525,"And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud, with power and great glory. ",selected_bible_verses
2526,"And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption is drawing nigh.  ",selected_bible_verses
2527,"And he spoke to them a parable: Behold the fig-tree, and all the trees. ",selected_bible_verses
2528,"When they already shoot forth, seeing it ye know of yourselves that the summer is already near. ",selected_bible_verses
2529,"So also ye, when ye see these things coming to pass, know that the kingdom of God is near. ",selected_bible_verses
2530,"Verily I say to you, this generation shall not pass away, till all shall have come to pass. ",selected_bible_verses
2531,Heaven and earth shall pass away; but my words shall not pass away.  ,selected_bible_verses
2532,"And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and that day come upon you unawares. ",selected_bible_verses
2533,For as a snare shall it come on all that dwell on the face of the whole earth. ,selected_bible_verses
2534,"And watch, in every time praying that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.  ",selected_bible_verses
2535,"And in the daytime he was teaching in the temple; and at night he went out, and abode in the mount that is called Olivet. ",selected_bible_verses
2536,"And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, to hear him.    XXII.  NOW the feast of unleavened bread was drawing near, which is called the Passover; ",selected_bible_verses
2537,and the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how they might kill him; for they feared the people.  ,selected_bible_verses
2538,"And Satan entered into Judas called Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve. ",selected_bible_verses
2539,"And he went away, and consulted with the chief priests and captains, how he might deliver him up to them. ",selected_bible_verses
2540,"And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money. ",selected_bible_verses
2541,"And he promised, and sought opportunity to deliver him up to them in the absence of the multitude.  ",selected_bible_verses
2542,"And the day of unleavened bread came, when the passover must be killed. ",selected_bible_verses
2543,"And he sent away Peter and John, saying: Go, and prepare us the passover, that we may eat it. ",selected_bible_verses
2544,And they said to him: Where wilt thou that we prepare? ,selected_bible_verses
2545,"And he said to them: Behold, when ye have entered into the city, there will meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he enters in. ",selected_bible_verses
2546,"And ye shall say to the master of the house: The Teacher says to thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I may eat the passover with my disciples? ",selected_bible_verses
2547,And he will show you a large upper room furnished; there make ready. ,selected_bible_verses
2548,"And they went away, and found as he had said to them. And they made ready the passover.  ",selected_bible_verses
2549,"And when the hour came, he reclined at table, and the apostles with him. ",selected_bible_verses
2550,And he said to them: I earnestly desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer. ,selected_bible_verses
2551,"For I say to you, I shall eat of it no more, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God. ",selected_bible_verses
2552,"And having received a cup, he gave thanks and said: Take this, and divide it among yourselves. ",selected_bible_verses
2553,"For I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.  ",selected_bible_verses
2554,"And taking a loaf, he gave thanks, and broke it, and gave to them, saying: This is my body which is given for you; this do in remembrance of me. ",selected_bible_verses
2555,"And the cup in like manner after supper, saying: This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is shed for you.  ",selected_bible_verses
2556,"But, behold, the hand of him that betrays me is with me on the table. ",selected_bible_verses
2557,"For the Son of man indeed goes, as it was determined; but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed! ",selected_bible_verses
2558,"And they began to inquire among themselves, who then it might be that should do this thing?  ",selected_bible_verses
2559,"And there arose also a contention among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest. ",selected_bible_verses
2560,And he said to them: The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they who exercise authority over them are called benefactors. ,selected_bible_verses
2561,"But ye are not so; but let the greatest among you become as the younger, and he that is chief as he that serves. ",selected_bible_verses
2562,"For which is greater, he that reclines at table, or he that serves? Is not he that reclines at table? But I am in the midst of you as he that serves. ",selected_bible_verses
2563,Ye are they who have continued with me in my temptations; ,selected_bible_verses
2564,"and I appoint to you a kingdom, as my Father appointed to me, ",selected_bible_verses
2565,"that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom; and ye shall sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.  ",selected_bible_verses
2566,"And the Lord said: Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked for you, to sift as the wheat. ",selected_bible_verses
2567,"But I prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not; and thou, when thou hast turned, strengthen thy brethren.  ",selected_bible_verses
2568,"And he said to him: Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both to prison and to death. ",selected_bible_verses
2569,"And he said: I say to thee, Peter, a cock will not crow this day, till thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.  ",selected_bible_verses
2570,"And he said to them: When I sent you without purse, and bag, and sandals, lacked ye anything? And they said: Nothing. ",selected_bible_verses
2571,"Therefore said he to them: But now, he that has a purse let him take it, and likewise a bag; and he that has not, let him sell his garment and buy a sword. ",selected_bible_verses
2572,"And they said: Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said: It is enough!  ",selected_bible_verses
2573,"And going out, he went as he was wont to the mount of the Olives; and his disciples also followed him. ",selected_bible_verses
2574,"And when he was at the place, he said to them: Pray that ye enter not into temptation. ",selected_bible_verses
2575,"And he withdrew from them about a stone's throw; and kneeling down, he prayed, ",selected_bible_verses
2576,"saying: Father, if thou art willing to remove this cup from me! Yet, not my will but thine be done.  ",selected_bible_verses
2577,"And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him. ",selected_bible_verses
2578,And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat became as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground. ,selected_bible_verses
2579,"And rising up from prayer, and coming to the disciples, he found them sleeping, from sorrow. ",selected_bible_verses
2580,"And he said to them: Why sleep ye? Arise and pray, that ye enter not into temptation.  ",selected_bible_verses
2581,"While he was yet speaking, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them and drew near to Jesus to kiss him. ",selected_bible_verses
2582,"But Jesus said to him: Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss? ",selected_bible_verses
2583,"And they who were about him, seeing what would follow, said to him: Lord, shall we smite with the sword? ",selected_bible_verses
2584,"And a certain one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and took off his right ear. ",selected_bible_verses
2585,"And Jesus answering said: Suffer thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him.  ",selected_bible_verses
2586,"And Jesus said to the chief priests and captains of the temple and elders, who were come to him: Have ye come out as against a robber, with swords and staves? ",selected_bible_verses
2587,"When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched not forth your hands against me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.  ",selected_bible_verses
2588,"And they took him, and led him away, and brought him into the house of the high priest. And Peter followed afar off.  ",selected_bible_verses
2589,"And they having kindled a fire in the midst of the court, and sat down together, Peter sat down among them. ",selected_bible_verses
2590,"And a certain maid seeing him as he sat by the fire, and looking intently upon him, said: This man also was with him. ",selected_bible_verses
2591,"And he denied him, saying: Woman, I do not know him.  ",selected_bible_verses
2592,"And after a little while, another seeing him said: Thou also art of them. And Peter said: Man, I am not.  ",selected_bible_verses
2593,"And about the space of one hour after, another confidently affirmed, saying: Of a truth this one also was with him; for he is a Galilaean. ",selected_bible_verses
2594,"And Peter said: Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he was yet speaking, a cock crowed.  ",selected_bible_verses
2595,"And the Lord turning looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he said to him: Before a cock crows this day, thou wilt deny me thrice. ",selected_bible_verses
2596,"And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.  ",selected_bible_verses
2597,"And the men who held Jesus mocked him, beating him; ",selected_bible_verses
2598,"and having blindfolded him they asked him, saying: Prophesy, who is it that smote thee? ",selected_bible_verses
2599,"And many other things they said, reviling him.  ",selected_bible_verses
2600,"If thou art the Christ, tell us. And he said to them: If I tell you, ye will not believe. ",selected_bible_verses
2601,"And if I ask, ye will not answer. ",selected_bible_verses
2602,But henceforth shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God. ,selected_bible_verses
2603,And they all said: Art thou then the Son of God? And he said to them: Ye say it; for I am. ,selected_bible_verses
2604,"And they said: Why need we any further witness? For we ourselves heard it from his own mouth.    XXIII.  AND the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate. ",selected_bible_verses
2605,"And they began to accuse him, saying: We found this man perverting our nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ, a king. ",selected_bible_verses
2606,"And Pilate asked him, saying: Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said to him: Thou sayest it. ",selected_bible_verses
2607,And Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes: I find no fault in this man. ,selected_bible_verses
2608,"And they were the more violent, saying: He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judaea, beginning from Galilee, unto this place.  ",selected_bible_verses
2609,"When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked if the man is a Galilaean. ",selected_bible_verses
2610,"And learning that he belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him up to Herod, who also was himself in Jerusalem at that time.  ",selected_bible_verses
2611,"And Herod, when he saw Jesus, rejoiced greatly; for he had desired for a long time to see him, because he had heard concerning him; and he hoped to see some sign wrought by him. ",selected_bible_verses
2612,And he questioned him in many words; but he answered him nothing. ,selected_bible_verses
2613,"And the chief priests and scribes stood, vehemently accusing him. ",selected_bible_verses
2614,"And Herod with his men of war set him at naught, and mocked him, and arraying him in a gorgeous robe sent him back to Pilate. ",selected_bible_verses
2615,And Pilate and Herod on that day became friends with each other; for before they were at enmity between themselves.  ,selected_bible_verses
2616,"And Pilate, having called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, ",selected_bible_verses
2617,"said to them: Ye brought to me this man, as one perverting the people; and, behold, I, having examined him before you, found no fault in this man, touching those things whereof ye accuse him. ",selected_bible_verses
2618,"No, nor yet Herod; for I sent you up to him; and behold, nothing worthy of death has been done by him. ",selected_bible_verses
2619,"I will therefore chastise, and release him. ",selected_bible_verses
2620,"And they cried out all at once, saying: Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas! ",selected_bible_verses
2621,"(who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)  ",selected_bible_verses
2622,"Again, therefore, Pilate spoke to them, desiring to release Jesus. ",selected_bible_verses
2623,"But they cried, saying: Crucify, crucify him. ",selected_bible_verses
2624,"And a third time he said to them: What evil then has this man done? I found no cause of death in him. I will therefore chastise, and release him. ",selected_bible_verses
2625,"And they were urgent with loud voices, requiring that he should be crucified. And their voices and those of the chief priests prevailed. ",selected_bible_verses
2626,"And Pilate gave sentence, that what they required should be done. ",selected_bible_verses
2627,"And he released him who for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they required; but Jesus he delivered up to their will.  ",selected_bible_verses
2628,"And as they led him away, they laid hold of one Simon a Cyrenian, coming from the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus. ",selected_bible_verses
2629,"And there followed him a great company of the people, and of women who also bewailed and lamented him. ",selected_bible_verses
2630,"But Jesus turning to them said: Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children. ",selected_bible_verses
2631,"For, behold, days are coming in which they shall say: Happy the barren, and wombs that never bore, and breasts that never gave suck. ",selected_bible_verses
2632,Then shall they begin to say to the mountains: Fall on us; and to the hills: Cover us. ,selected_bible_verses
2633,"For if they do these things in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry?  ",selected_bible_verses
2634,"And there were also two others, malefactors, led with him to be put to death. ",selected_bible_verses
2635,"And when they had gone away to the place which is called A Skull, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left. ",selected_bible_verses
2636,"And Jesus said: Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they divided his garments, casting lots.  ",selected_bible_verses
2637,"And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also scoffed, saying: Others he saved; let him save himself, if he is the Christ, the chosen of God. ",selected_bible_verses
2638,"And the soldiers also coming to him mocked him, offering him vinegar, ",selected_bible_verses
2639,"and saying: If thou art the King of the Jews, save thyself.  ",selected_bible_verses
2640,And there was an inscription written over him: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.  ,selected_bible_verses
2641,"And one of the malefactors who were hanged railed at him, saying: If thou art the Christ, save thyself and us. ",selected_bible_verses
2642,"But the other answering rebuked him, saying: Dost thou not even fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation? ",selected_bible_verses
2643,And we indeed justly; for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man did nothing amiss. ,selected_bible_verses
2644,"And he said to Jesus: Remember me, when thou comest in thy kingdom. ",selected_bible_verses
2645,"And Jesus said to him: Verily I say to thee, to-day thou shalt be with me in paradise.  ",selected_bible_verses
2646,And it was about the sixth hour; and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour. ,selected_bible_verses
2647,And the sun was darkened; and the vail of the temple was rent in the midst. ,selected_bible_verses
2648,"And Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said: Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit. And having said this, he expired.  ",selected_bible_verses
2649,"And the centurion, seeing what was done, glorified God, saying: Verily, this man was righteous! ",selected_bible_verses
2650,"And all the multitudes who had come together to that sight, having beheld the things that were done, returned, beating their breasts. ",selected_bible_verses
2651,"And all his acquaintance were standing afar off, and women who had followed him from Galilee, beholding these things.  ",selected_bible_verses
2652,"And, behold, a man named Joseph, a counselor, a good and just man, ",selected_bible_verses
2653,"(he had not consented to their counsel and deed), from Arimathaea a city of the Jews, who was waiting for the kingdom of God, ",selected_bible_verses
2654,"this man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. ",selected_bible_verses
2655,"And taking it down, he wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in the rock, where no one was yet laid. ",selected_bible_verses
2656,"And it was the day of preparation, and the sabbath drew on. ",selected_bible_verses
2657,"And the women also, who had come with him out of Galilee, followed after, and viewed the sepulchre, and how his body was laid. ",selected_bible_verses
2658,"And returning, they prepared spices and ointments; and on the sabbath they rested, according to the commandment.    XXIV.  NOW on the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came to the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they prepared. ",selected_bible_verses
2659,And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre. ,selected_bible_verses
2660,"And entering in, they found not the body of the Lord Jesus. ",selected_bible_verses
2661,"And it came to pass, that as they were much perplexed concerning this, behold two men stood by them in shining garments. ",selected_bible_verses
2662,"And they being afraid and bowing their faces to the earth, they said to them: Why seek ye the living among the dead? ",selected_bible_verses
2663,"He is not here, but is risen. Remember how he spoke to you when he was yet in Galilee, ",selected_bible_verses
2664,"saying: The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again. ",selected_bible_verses
2665,And they remembered his words.  ,selected_bible_verses
2666,"And returning from the sepulchre, they reported all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest. ",selected_bible_verses
2667,"And it was Mary the Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them, who said these things to the apostles. ",selected_bible_verses
2668,"And their words seemed to them as idle talk, and they believed them not.  ",selected_bible_verses
2669,"But Peter rose up, and ran to the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beholds the linen cloths lying by themselves; and he departed to his home, wondering at that which was come to pass.  ",selected_bible_verses
2670,"And, behold, two of them were going on that same day to a village called Emmaus, distant sixty furlongs from Jerusalem. ",selected_bible_verses
2671,And they were conversing together concerning all these things that had taken place. ,selected_bible_verses
2672,"And it came to pass, that while they were conversing and reasoning, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them. ",selected_bible_verses
2673,But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.  ,selected_bible_verses
2674,"And he said to them: What communications are these, that ye have one with another, as ye walk, and are sad? ",selected_bible_verses
2675,"And one, whose name was Cleopas, answering said to him: Dost thou alone sojourn in Jerusalem and not know the things that have come to pass there in these days? ",selected_bible_verses
2676,"And he said to them: What things? And they said to him: The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people; ",selected_bible_verses
2677,"and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him. ",selected_bible_verses
2678,"But we were hoping that it was he who was to redeem Israel. But indeed, beside all this, to-day is the third day since these things were done. ",selected_bible_verses
2679,"Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, who were early at the sepulchre; ",selected_bible_verses
2680,"and not finding his body, came saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, who say that he is alive. ",selected_bible_verses
2681,"And some of those who were with us went away to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women said; but him they saw not.  ",selected_bible_verses
2682,"Then he said to them: O foolish, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! ",selected_bible_verses
2683,"Was it not necessary, that the Christ should suffer these things, and enter into his glory? ",selected_bible_verses
2684,"And beginning from Moses, and all the prophets, he explained to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.  ",selected_bible_verses
2685,"And they drew near to the village, whither they were going; and he made as though he would go further. ",selected_bible_verses
2686,"But they constrained him, saying: Abide with us; for it is toward evening, and the day has declined. And he went in to abide with them.  ",selected_bible_verses
2687,"And it came to pass, that as he was reclining at table with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and breaking, gave to them. ",selected_bible_verses
2688,"And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight. ",selected_bible_verses
2689,"And they said one to another: Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked to us in the way, and while he opened to us the Scriptures?  ",selected_bible_verses
2690,"And rising up in the same hour, they returned to Jerusalem; and they found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together, ",selected_bible_verses
2691,"saying: The Lord is risen indeed, and he appeared to Simon. ",selected_bible_verses
2692,"And they related what things were done in the way, and how he became known by them in the breaking of bread.  ",selected_bible_verses
2693,"And while they were speaking these things, he himself stood in the midst of them, and says to them: Peace be to you. ",selected_bible_verses
2694,"But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they beheld a spirit. ",selected_bible_verses
2695,And he said to them: Why are ye troubled? And wherefore do thoughts arise in your hearts? ,selected_bible_verses
2696,"See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Handle me, and see; for a spirit has not flesh and bones, as ye see me have. ",selected_bible_verses
2697,"And having said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. ",selected_bible_verses
2698,"And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said to them: Have ye here anything to eat? ",selected_bible_verses
2699,"And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of a honeycomb. ",selected_bible_verses
2700,"And he took, and ate it before them. ",selected_bible_verses
2701,"And he said to them: These are my words which I spoke to you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which are written in the law of Moses, and the prophets, and psalms, concerning me. ",selected_bible_verses
2702,"Then he opened their understanding, that they might understand the Scriptures. ",selected_bible_verses
2703,"And he said to them: Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer, and should rise from the dead on the third day; ",selected_bible_verses
2704,"and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all the nations, beginning at Jerusalem. ",selected_bible_verses
2705,Ye are witnesses of these things.  ,selected_bible_verses
2706,"And, behold, I send forth the promise of my Father upon you. But do ye tarry in the city, until ye are endued with power from on high.  ",selected_bible_verses
2707,"And he led them out as far as to Bethany; and lifting up his hands, he blessed them. ",selected_bible_verses
2708,"And it came to pass, while he blessed them, that he parted from them, and was borne up into heaven. ",selected_bible_verses
2709,"And they, having worshiped him, returned to Jerusalem with great joy; ",selected_bible_verses
2710,"and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God.    THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO JOHN.   I.  IN the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. ",selected_bible_verses
2711,The same was in the beginning with God. ,selected_bible_verses
2712,In him was life; and the life was the light of men. ,selected_bible_verses
2713,And the light shines in the darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.  ,selected_bible_verses
2714,"There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. ",selected_bible_verses
2715,"The same came for witness, to bear witness of the light, that through him all might believe. ",selected_bible_verses
2716,He was not the light; but [came] to bear witness of the light. ,selected_bible_verses
2717,"There was the true light, which lights every man that comes into the world. ",selected_bible_verses
2718,"He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. ",selected_bible_verses
2719,"He came to his own, and his own received him not. ",selected_bible_verses
2720,"But as many as received him, to them he gave power to become children of God, to those who believe on his name; ",selected_bible_verses
2721,"who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.  ",selected_bible_verses
2722,"Because out of his fullness we all received, and grace for grace. ",selected_bible_verses
2723,For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. ,selected_bible_verses
2724,"No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he declared him.  ",selected_bible_verses
2725,"And this is the witness of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him: Who art thou? ",selected_bible_verses
2726,"And he confessed, and denied not; and he confessed: I am not the Christ. ",selected_bible_verses
2727,And they asked him: What then? Art thou Elijah? And he says: I am not. Art thou the Prophet? And he answered: No. ,selected_bible_verses
2728,They said therefore to him: Who art thou? that we may give an answer to those who sent us. What sayest thou of thyself? ,selected_bible_verses
2729,"He said: I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness: Make straight the way of the Lord, as said Isaiah the prophet.  ",selected_bible_verses
2730,And they who were sent were of the Pharisees. ,selected_bible_verses
2731,"And they asked him, and said to him: Why then dost thou immerse, if thou art not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet? ",selected_bible_verses
2732,"John answered them, saying: I immerse in water. There stands one in the midst of you, whom ye know not; ",selected_bible_verses
2733,"he who comes after me, the latchet of whose sandal I am not worthy to loose.  ",selected_bible_verses
2734,"These things took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was immersing.  ",selected_bible_verses
2735,"On the morrow, he sees Jesus coming to him, and says: Behold the Lamb of God, that takes away the sin of the world! ",selected_bible_verses
2736,"And I knew him not; but that he might be made manifest to Israel, for this I came immersing in water.  ",selected_bible_verses
2737,"And John bore witness, saying: I have seen the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and it abode upon him. ",selected_bible_verses
2738,"And I knew him not; but he who sent me to immerse in water, the same said to me: Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and abiding on him, the same is he who immerses in the Holy Spirit. ",selected_bible_verses
2739,"And I have seen, and have borne witness, that this is the Son of God.  ",selected_bible_verses
2740,"Again, on the morrow, John was standing, and two of his disciples; ",selected_bible_verses
2741,"and looking upon Jesus as he walked, he says: Behold the Lamb of God! ",selected_bible_verses
2742,"And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. ",selected_bible_verses
2743,"And Jesus turning, and beholding them following, says to them: What seek ye? They said to him: Rabbi (which interpreted means, Teacher), where dost thou abide? ",selected_bible_verses
2744,"He says to them: Come, and ye shall see. They came and saw where he abode; and they abode with him that day. It was about the tenth hour.  ",selected_bible_verses
2745,"Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two who heard it from John, and followed him. ",selected_bible_verses
2746,"He first finds his brother Simon, and says to him: We have found the Messiah, which is interpreted, Christ. ",selected_bible_verses
2747,On the morrow he would go forth into Galilee. And he finds Philip; and Jesus says to him: Follow me. ,selected_bible_verses
2748,"Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter. ",selected_bible_verses
2749,"Philip finds Nathanael, and says to him: We have found him of whom Moses, in the law, and the prophets wrote, Jesus the son of Joseph, who is from Nazareth. ",selected_bible_verses
2750,And Nathanael said to him: Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip says to him: Come and see. ,selected_bible_verses
2751,"Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and says of him: Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile! ",selected_bible_verses
2752,"Nathanael says to him: Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said to him: Before Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee. ",selected_bible_verses
2753,"Nathanael answered: Rabbi; thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel. ",selected_bible_verses
2754,"Jesus answered and said to him: Because I said to thee, I saw thee under the fig-tree, believest thou? Thou shalt see greater things than these. ",selected_bible_verses
2755,"And Jesus also was bidden, and his disciples, to the marriage. ",selected_bible_verses
2756,"And wine having failed, the mother of Jesus says to him: They have no wine. ",selected_bible_verses
2757,"Jesus says to her: Woman, what have I to do with thee? My hour is not yet come. ",selected_bible_verses
2758,"His mother says to the servants: Whatever he says to you, do it. ",selected_bible_verses
2759,Jesus says to them: Fill the water-pots with water. And they filled them up to the brim. ,selected_bible_verses
2760,"And he says to them: Draw out now, and bear to the ruler of the feast. And they bore it. ",selected_bible_verses
2761,"When the ruler of the feast tasted the water that was made wine (and he knew not whence it was, but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the ruler of the feast called the bridegroom, ",selected_bible_verses
2762,"and says to him: Every man sets forth the good wine first; and when they have drunk freely, then that which is worse. Thou hast kept the good wine until now. ",selected_bible_verses
2763,"This beginning of the signs Jesus wrought in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him.  ",selected_bible_verses
2764,"After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brothers, and his disciples; and they abode there not many days.  ",selected_bible_verses
2765,And the passover of the Jews was at hand; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. ,selected_bible_verses
2766,"And he found in the temple those who sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the money-changers sitting. ",selected_bible_verses
2767,"And having made a scourge of small cords, he drove all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables; ",selected_bible_verses
2768,and to those who sold doves he said: Take these things hence; make not my Father's house a house of merchandise. ,selected_bible_verses
2769,And his disciples remembered that it is written: for thy house consumes me.  ,selected_bible_verses
2770,"The Jews therefore answered and said to him: What sign dost thou show to us, seeing that thou doest these things? ",selected_bible_verses
2771,"Jesus answered and said to them: Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. ",selected_bible_verses
2772,"Therefore said the Jews: Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou raise it up in three days? ",selected_bible_verses
2773,But he said it of the temple of his body. ,selected_bible_verses
2774,"When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he said this; and they believed the Scripture, and the word which Jesus spoke.  ",selected_bible_verses
2775,"And when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, on the feast-day, many believed on his name, beholding his signs which he wrought. ",selected_bible_verses
2776,"But Jesus did not trust himself to them, because he knew all men, ",selected_bible_verses
2777,"and had no need that any one should testify of man; for he himself knew what was in man.    III.  THERE was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. ",selected_bible_verses
2778,"The same came to him by night, and said to him: Rabbi, we know that thou hast come a teacher from God; for no one can do these signs which thou doest, except God be with him.  ",selected_bible_verses
2779,"Nicodemus says to him: How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?  ",selected_bible_verses
2780,"Jesus answered: Verily, verily, I say to thee, except a man be born of water and the Spirit, he can not enter into the kingdom of God. ",selected_bible_verses

2782,Marvel not that I said to thee: Ye must be born again.  ,selected_bible_verses

2784,Nicodemus answered and said to him: How can these things be? ,selected_bible_verses
2785,"Jesus answered and said to him: Art thou the teacher of Israel, and knowest not these things? ",selected_bible_verses
2786,"Verily, verily, I say to thee, we speak that which we know, and testify that which we have seen; and ye receive not our testimony. ",selected_bible_verses
2787,"If I told you the earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you the heavenly things? ",selected_bible_verses
2788,"And no one has ascended up into heaven, but he who came down out of heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven. ",selected_bible_verses
2789,"And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of man be lifted up; ",selected_bible_verses
2790,that every one who believes on him may have everlasting life. ,selected_bible_verses
2791,"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whoever believes on him, should not perish, but may have everlasting life. ",selected_bible_verses
2792,For God sent not his Son into the world to judge the world; but that the world through him might be saved. ,selected_bible_verses
2793,"He that believes on him is not judged; but he that believes not has already been judged, because he has not believed on the name of the only-begotten Son of God. ",selected_bible_verses
2794,"And this is the judgment, that light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their deeds were evil. ",selected_bible_verses
2795,"For every one that does evil hates the light, and comes not to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. ",selected_bible_verses
2796,"But he that does the truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.  ",selected_bible_verses
2797,"After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he remained with them, and immersed. ",selected_bible_verses
2798,"And John also was immersing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there; and they came, and were immersed. ",selected_bible_verses
2799,For John was not yet cast into prison.  ,selected_bible_verses
2800,"There arose therefore a question, on the part of John's disciples with a Jew, about purification. ",selected_bible_verses
2801,"And they came to John and said to him: Rabbi, he who was with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou hast borne witness, behold, he immerses, and all come to him.  ",selected_bible_verses
2802,"John answered and said: A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven. ",selected_bible_verses

2810,"He that believes on the Son has everlasting life; and he that believes not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.    IV.  WHEN therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees heard, that Jesus made and immersed more disciples than John ",selected_bible_verses
2811,"(though Jesus himself immersed not, but his disciples), ",selected_bible_verses
2812,"he left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee. ",selected_bible_verses
2813,And he must go through Samaria. ,selected_bible_verses
2814,"And Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with the journey, sat down thus on the well. It was about the sixth hour.  ",selected_bible_verses
2815,"There comes a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus, says to her: Give me to drink. ",selected_bible_verses
2816,For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food. ,selected_bible_verses
2817,"The Samaritan woman therefore says to him: How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, being a Samaritan woman? For Jews do not associate with Samaritans. ",selected_bible_verses
2818,"Jesus answered and said to her: If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that says to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. ",selected_bible_verses
2819,"The woman says to him: Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. From whence then hast thou the living water. ",selected_bible_verses
2820,"Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle? ",selected_bible_verses
2821,Jesus answered and said to her: Every one that drinks of this water shall thirst again. ,selected_bible_verses
2822,"But whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water, springing up into everlasting life. ",selected_bible_verses
2823,"The woman says to him: Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come hither to draw.  ",selected_bible_verses
2824,"Jesus says to her: Go, call thy husband, and come hither. ",selected_bible_verses
2825,"The woman answered and said: I have no husband. Jesus says to her: Thou saidst well, I have no husband. ",selected_bible_verses
2826,For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband. That thou hast spoken truly.  ,selected_bible_verses
2827,"The woman says to him: Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. ",selected_bible_verses
2828,"Our fathers worshiped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. ",selected_bible_verses
2829,"Jesus says to her: Woman, believe me, an hour is coming, when ye shall neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem worship the Father. ",selected_bible_verses
2830,Ye worship that which ye know not; we worship that which we know; because salvation is of the Jews. ,selected_bible_verses
2831,"But an hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth; for such the Father seeks to worship him. ",selected_bible_verses
2832,"God is spirit; and they that worship him, must worship in spirit and in truth.  ",selected_bible_verses
2833,"The woman says to him: I know that Messiah comes (who is called Christ); when he is come, he will tell us all things. ",selected_bible_verses
2834,Jesus says to her: I that speak to thee am he. ,selected_bible_verses
2835,"The woman then left her water-pot, and went away into the city; and she says to the men: ",selected_bible_verses
2836,"Come, see a man who told me all things that ever I did. Is this the Christ? ",selected_bible_verses
2837,"Then they went out of the city, and came to him.  ",selected_bible_verses
2838,"In the mean while the disciples prayed him, saying: Master, eat. ",selected_bible_verses
2839,But he said to them: I have food to eat that ye know not of. ,selected_bible_verses
2840,Therefore said the disciples one to another: Has any one brought him aught to eat? ,selected_bible_verses
2841,"Jesus says to them: My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to finish his work. ",selected_bible_verses
2842,"Do ye not say, that there are yet four months, and then comes the harvest? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes and look on the fields, that they are already white for harvest. ",selected_bible_verses

2845,"I sent you to reap that whereon ye have not labored. Other men have labored, and ye have entered into their labor.  ",selected_bible_verses
2846,"And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, who testified: He told me all that ever I did. ",selected_bible_verses
2847,"When therefore the Samaritans came to him, they besought him to remain with them. And he remained there two days. ",selected_bible_verses
2848,And far more believed because of his word; ,selected_bible_verses
2849,"and said to the woman: We no longer believe because of thy saying; for we ourselves have heard, and know that this is in truth the Savior of the world.  ",selected_bible_verses
2850,"And after the two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee. ",selected_bible_verses
2851,"For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet has no honor in his own country.  ",selected_bible_verses
2852,"When therefore he came into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all that he did in Jerusalem at the feast; for they also went to the feast. ",selected_bible_verses
2853,"So he came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine.  And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick, in Capernaum. ",selected_bible_verses
2854,"He, having heard that Jesus is come out of Judaea into Galilee, went to him, and besought him that he would come down and heal his son; for he was about to die. ",selected_bible_verses
2855,"Jesus therefore said to him: Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe. ",selected_bible_verses
2856,"The nobleman says to him: Sir, come down ere my child die. ",selected_bible_verses
2857,"Jesus says to him: Go thy way; thy son lives. And the man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his way. ",selected_bible_verses
2858,"And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and brought word saying: Thy child lives. ",selected_bible_verses
2859,"He inquired of them, therefore, the hour when he began to amend. And they said to him: Yesterday, at the seventh hour, the fever left him. ",selected_bible_verses
2860,"The father knew, therefore, that it was in the same hour in which Jesus said to him: Thy son lives. And he himself believed, and his whole house. ",selected_bible_verses
2861,"This second sign Jesus wrought, when he had come out of Judaea into Galilee.    V.  AFTER these things there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. ",selected_bible_verses
2862,"And there is in Jerusalem by the sheep-gate a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches. ",selected_bible_verses
2863,"In these lay a multitude of the infirm, of blind, lame, withered [waiting for the moving of the water. ",selected_bible_verses
2864,"And a certain man was there, who had an infirmity thirty and eight years. ",selected_bible_verses
2865,"Jesus seeing this man lying, and knowing that he had been already a long time thus, says to him: Dost thou desire to be made whole? ",selected_bible_verses
2866,"The infirm man answered him: Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool; but while I am coming, another goes down before me. ",selected_bible_verses
2867,"Jesus says to him: Rise, take up thy bed, and walk. ",selected_bible_verses
2868,"And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed and walked.  And on that day was the sabbath. ",selected_bible_verses
2869,The Jews therefore said to him that was cured: It is the sabbath; it is not lawful for thee to carry the bed. ,selected_bible_verses
2870,"He answered them: He who made me whole, the same said to me: Take up thy bed, and walk. ",selected_bible_verses
2871,They asked him therefore: Who is the man that said to thee: Take up thy bed and walk? ,selected_bible_verses
2872,"And he who was healed knew not who it was; for Jesus conveyed himself away, there being a multitude in the place.  ",selected_bible_verses
2873,"Afterward Jesus finds him in the temple. And he said to him: Behold, thou hast been made whole; sin no more, lest something worse befall thee. ",selected_bible_verses
2874,"The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who made him whole. ",selected_bible_verses
2875,"And for this the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he did these things on the sabbath. ",selected_bible_verses
2876,"But Jesus answered them: My Father works hitherto, and I work. ",selected_bible_verses
2877,"For this therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only broke the sabbath, but also called God his Father, making himself equal with God.  ",selected_bible_verses
2878,"Jesus therefore, answered and said to them: Verily, verily, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father do; for what things soever he does, these also does the Son in like manner. ",selected_bible_verses
2879,"For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all things that he himself does; and greater works than these will he show him, that ye may marvel. ",selected_bible_verses
2880,"For as the Father raises up the dead, and quickens them; so also the Son quickens whom he will. ",selected_bible_verses
2881,For neither does the Father judge any one; but all judgment he has given to the Son; ,selected_bible_verses
2882,"that all may honor the Son, as they honor the Father. He that honors not the Son, honors not the Father who sent him.  ",selected_bible_verses
2883,"Verily, verily, I say to you, he that hears my word, and believes him who sent me, has everlasting life, and comes not into judgment, but has passed out of death into life. ",selected_bible_verses
2884,"Verily, verily, I say to you, an hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear shall live. ",selected_bible_verses
2885,"For as the Father has life in himself, so he gave also to the Son to have life in himself. ",selected_bible_verses
2886,"And he gave him authority to execute judgment also, because he is a son of man. ",selected_bible_verses
2887,"Marvel not at this; for an hour is coming, in which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, ",selected_bible_verses
2888,"and shall come forth; they that did good, to the resurrection of life, and they that did evil, to the resurrection of judgment.  ",selected_bible_verses
2889,"I can of myself do nothing. As I hear, I judge; and my judgment is just; because I seek not my own will, but the will of him who sent me.  ",selected_bible_verses
2890,"If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true. ",selected_bible_verses
2891,There is another that bears witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesses of me is true. ,selected_bible_verses
2892,"Ye have sent to John, and he has borne witness to the truth. ",selected_bible_verses
2893,"But I receive the witness not from man; but these things I say, that ye might be saved. ",selected_bible_verses
2894,He was the burning and shining lamp; and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light. ,selected_bible_verses
2895,"But I have greater witness than that of John; for the works which the Father gave me to finish, the works themselves that I do bear witness of me, that the Father has sent me. ",selected_bible_verses
2896,"And the Father, who sent me, he has borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor have ye seen his shape. ",selected_bible_verses
2897,"And ye have not his word abiding in you; for whom he sent, him ye believe not.  ",selected_bible_verses
2898,"and ye will not come to me, that ye may have life. ",selected_bible_verses
2899,I receive not honor from men. ,selected_bible_verses
2900,"But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you. ",selected_bible_verses
2901,"I have come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not; if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive. ",selected_bible_verses
2902,"How can ye believe, receiving honor from one another, and the honor that is from God alone ye seek not? ",selected_bible_verses
2903,"Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father; there is one that accuses you, Moses in whom ye have placed your hope. ",selected_bible_verses
2904,"For if ye believed Moses, ye would believe me; for he wrote of me. ",selected_bible_verses
2905,"But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?    VI.  AFTER these things Jesus went away, beyond the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias. ",selected_bible_verses
2906,"And a great multitude followed him, because they saw the signs which he wrought on the sick. ",selected_bible_verses
2907,"And Jesus went up into the mountain, and there he sat with his disciples. ",selected_bible_verses
2908,"And the passover, the feast of the Jews, was near. ",selected_bible_verses
2909,"Jesus therefore lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a great multitude is coming to him, says to Philip: Whence shall we buy bread that these may eat? ",selected_bible_verses
2910,And this he said to try him; for he himself knew what he was about to do. ,selected_bible_verses
2911,"Philip answered him: Two hundred denaries worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that each one may take a little. ",selected_bible_verses
2912,"One of his disciples, Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, says to him: ",selected_bible_verses
2913,"There is a lad here, who has five barley loaves and two small fishes; but what are they among so many? ",selected_bible_verses
2914,"Jesus said: Make the men lie down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men lay down, in number about five thousand. ",selected_bible_verses
2915,"And Jesus took the loaves; and having given thanks, he distributed to those who were lying down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they desired. ",selected_bible_verses
2916,"When they were filled, he said to his disciples: Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost. ",selected_bible_verses
2917,"Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above to those who had eaten. ",selected_bible_verses
2918,"The men therefore, seeing the sign that Jesus wrought, said: This is of a truth the Prophet that comes into the world.  ",selected_bible_verses
2919,"Jesus therefore, knowing that they were about to come and take him by force, to make him a king, withdrew again into the mountain, himself alone. ",selected_bible_verses
2920,"And when evening came, his disciples went down to the sea, ",selected_bible_verses
2921,"and entering into the ship, were going over the sea to Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus had not come to them; ",selected_bible_verses
2922,"and as a strong wind was blowing, the sea began to rise. ",selected_bible_verses
2923,"When therefore they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing near to the ship; and they were afraid. ",selected_bible_verses
2924,"But he says to them: It is I, be not afraid. ",selected_bible_verses
2925,They therefore willingly received him into the ship; and immediately the ship was at the land whither they were going.  ,selected_bible_verses
2926,"On the morrow, the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea, seeing that there was no other boat there but one, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the ship, but his disciples went away alone ",selected_bible_verses
2927,"(but there came other boats from Tiberias near to the place where they ate bread, when the Lord had given thanks); ",selected_bible_verses
2928,"when therefore the multitude saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they themselves entered into the boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus. ",selected_bible_verses
2929,"And having found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him: Rabbi, when camest thou hither? ",selected_bible_verses
2930,"Jesus answered them and said: Verily, verily, I say to you, ye seek me, not because ye saw signs, but because ye ate of the loaves and were filled. ",selected_bible_verses
2931,"Work not for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures unto everlasting life, which the Son of man will give to you; for him the Father, God, has sealed, ",selected_bible_verses
2932,"Therefore they said to him: What shall we do, that we may work the works of God? ",selected_bible_verses
2933,"Jesus answered and said to them: This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he sent. ",selected_bible_verses
2934,"They therefore said to him: What sign doest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? What dost thou work? ",selected_bible_verses
2935,Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written: He gave them bread from heaven to eat. ,selected_bible_verses
2936,"Jesus therefore said to them: Verily, verily, I say to you, Moses has not given you the bread from heaven; but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven. ",selected_bible_verses
2937,"They therefore said to him: Lord, evermore give us this bread. ",selected_bible_verses
2938,"Jesus said to them: I am the bread of life. He that comes to me shall never hunger, and he that believes on me shall never thirst. ",selected_bible_verses
2939,"But I said to you, that ye have also seen me, and do not believe. ",selected_bible_verses
2940,All that the Father gives me will come to me; and him that comes to me I will not cast out. ,selected_bible_verses
2941,"Because I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me. ",selected_bible_verses
2942,"And this is the will of him who sent me, that of all which he has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up at the last day. ",selected_bible_verses
2943,"For this is the will of my Father, that every one who sees the Son, and believes on him, may have everlasting life; and I will raise him up at the last day.  ",selected_bible_verses
2944,"The Jews therefore murmured at him, because he said: I am the bread that came down out of heaven. ",selected_bible_verses
2945,"And they said: Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How then does this man say: I have come down out of heaven?  ",selected_bible_verses
2946,Jesus answered and said to them: Murmur not among yourselves. ,selected_bible_verses
2947,"No one can come to me, except the Father who sent me draw him; and I will raise him up at the last day. ",selected_bible_verses
2948,"It is written in the prophets: And they shall all be taught of God. Every one that has heard from the Father, and has learned, comes to me. ",selected_bible_verses
2949,"Not that any one has seen the Father, save he who is from God; he has seen the Father.  ",selected_bible_verses
2950,"Verily, verily, I say to you, he that believes on me has everlasting life. ",selected_bible_verses
2951,I am the bread of life. ,selected_bible_verses
2952,"Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and are dead. ",selected_bible_verses
2953,"This is the bread that comes down out of heaven, that one may eat thereof, and not die. ",selected_bible_verses
2954,"I am the living bread that came down out of heaven. If any one eat of this bread, he shall live forever; yea, and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.  ",selected_bible_verses
2955,"The Jews therefore contended with one another, saying: How can this man give us his flesh to eat? ",selected_bible_verses
2956,"Jesus therefore said to them: Verily, verily, I say to you, except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you. ",selected_bible_verses
2957,"He that eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, has eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. ",selected_bible_verses
2958,"For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink. ",selected_bible_verses
2959,"He that eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, abides in me, and I in him. ",selected_bible_verses
2960,"As the living Father has sent me, and I live because of the Father; so he that eats me, he also shall live because of me. ",selected_bible_verses
2961,"This is the bread that came down out of heaven. Not as your fathers ate the manna, and are dead; he that eats of this bread shall live forever.  ",selected_bible_verses
2962,"These things he said in the synagogue, while teaching in Capernaum.  ",selected_bible_verses
2963,"Many therefore of his disciples, when they heard it, said: This is a hard saying; who can hear it? ",selected_bible_verses
2964,"But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this, said to them: Does this offend you? ",selected_bible_verses
2965,What then if ye behold the Son of man ascending up where he was before? ,selected_bible_verses
2966,"It is the spirit that makes alive, the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit, and are life. ",selected_bible_verses
2967,"But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who it was that should betray him. ",selected_bible_verses
2968,"And he said: For this cause I have said to you, that no one can come to me, except it be given him from the Father.  ",selected_bible_verses
2969,"From this time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.  ",selected_bible_verses
2970,Jesus said therefore to the twelve: Will ye also go away? ,selected_bible_verses
2971,"Simon Peter answered him: Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast words of eternal life. ",selected_bible_verses
2972,"And we believe and know, that thou art the Holy One of God. ",selected_bible_verses
2973,"Jesus answered them: Did I not choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil? ",selected_bible_verses
2974,"He spoke of Judas Iscariot, son of Simon; for he it was that would betray him, being one of the twelve.    VII.  AND after these things Jesus walked in Galilee; for he would not walk in Judaea, because the Jews were seeking to kill him.  ",selected_bible_verses
2975,"Now the feast of the Jews, the feast of tabernacles, was at hand. ",selected_bible_verses
2976,"His brothers therefore said to him: Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may behold thy works that thou doest. ",selected_bible_verses
2977,"For no one does anything in secret, and he himself seeks to be known openly. If thou doest these things, manifest thyself to the world. ",selected_bible_verses
2978,For neither did his brothers believe on him. ,selected_bible_verses
2979,Jesus therefore says to them: My time is not yet come; but your time is always ready. ,selected_bible_verses
2980,"The world can not hate you; but me it hates, because I testify of it, that its works are evil. ",selected_bible_verses
2981,Go ye up to the feast. I go not up to this feast; because my time is not yet fully come.  ,selected_bible_verses
2982,"Having said these things to them, he remained in Galilee. ",selected_bible_verses
2983,"But when his brothers were gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not openly, but as it were in secret.  ",selected_bible_verses
2984,"The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said: Where is he? ",selected_bible_verses
2985,"And there was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him. Some said: He is a good man; others said: Nay, but he misleads the multitude. ",selected_bible_verses
2986,"No one, however, spoke openly of him, for fear of the Jews.  ",selected_bible_verses
2987,"But when it was already the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught. ",selected_bible_verses
2988,"And the Jews wondered, saying: How knows this man letters, having never learned? ",selected_bible_verses
2989,"Jesus therefore answered them, and said: My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me. ",selected_bible_verses
2990,"If any one desires to do his will, he shall know of the teaching, whether it is of God, or whether I speak from myself. ",selected_bible_verses
2991,"He that speaks from himself seeks his own glory; but he that seeks the glory of him who sent him, the same is true, and there is no unrighteousness in him.  ",selected_bible_verses
2992,"Has not Moses given you the law, and none of you keeps the law? Why do ye seek to kill me? ",selected_bible_verses
2993,The multitude answered and said: Thou hast a demon; who seeks to kill thee? ,selected_bible_verses
2994,"Jesus answered and said to them: I did one work, and ye all marvel. ",selected_bible_verses
2995,"Moses has for this cause given you circumcision, not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers; and on the sabbath ye circumcise a man. ",selected_bible_verses
2996,"If a man receives circumcision on the sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I made a man altogether whole on the sabbath? ",selected_bible_verses
2997,"Judge not according to appearance, but judge the righteous judgment.  ",selected_bible_verses
2998,Then said some of those of Jerusalem: Is not this he whom they seek to kill? ,selected_bible_verses
2999,"But we know this man, whence he is; but when the Christ comes, no one knows whence he is.  ",selected_bible_verses

3001,"I know him; because I am from him, and he sent me. ",selected_bible_verses
3002,"Therefore they sought to seize him; and no one laid hands on him, because his hour had not yet come.  ",selected_bible_verses
3003,"But of the multitude many believed on him, and said: When the Christ comes, will he work more signs than these which this man wrought? ",selected_bible_verses
3004,The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him; and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to seize him. ,selected_bible_verses
3005,"Jesus therefore said: Yet a little while I am with you, and I go to him who sent me. ",selected_bible_verses
3006,"Ye will seek me, and shall not find me; and where I am, ye can not come. ",selected_bible_verses
3007,"The Jews said therefore among themselves: Whither will this man go, that we shall not find him? Will he go to those dispersed among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks? ",selected_bible_verses

3009,"In the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying: If any one thirst, let him come to me and drink. ",selected_bible_verses
3010,"He that believes on me, as said the Scripture, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. ",selected_bible_verses
3011,"And this he spoke concerning the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive; for the Holy Spirit was not yet [given], because Jesus was not yet glorified.  ",selected_bible_verses
3012,"Some of the multitude therefore, hearing the words, said: Of a truth this is the Prophet. ",selected_bible_verses
3013,Others said: This is the Christ. But some said: Does the Christ then come out of Galilee? ,selected_bible_verses
3014,"Did not the Scripture say, that the Christ comes of the seed of David, and from the town of Bethlehem, where David was? ",selected_bible_verses
3015,A division therefore arose among the multitude because of him. ,selected_bible_verses
3016,And some of them desired to seize him; but no one laid hands on him.  ,selected_bible_verses
3017,The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said to them: Why did ye not bring him? ,selected_bible_verses
3018,The Pharisees answered them: Are ye also led astray? ,selected_bible_verses
3019,"Did any of the rulers believe on him, or of the Pharisees? ",selected_bible_verses
3020,"But this multitude, that know not the law, are accursed. ",selected_bible_verses

3022,"Does our law judge a man, except it first hear from him, and know what he does? ",selected_bible_verses
3023,"And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came to him; and having sat down, he was teaching them. ",selected_bible_verses
3024,"And the scribes and the Pharisees bring to him a woman taken in adultery; and having placed her in the midst, ",selected_bible_verses
3025,"they say to him: Teacher, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act: ",selected_bible_verses
3026,"Now in the law Moses commanded us, that such should be stoned; what then dost thou say? ",selected_bible_verses
3027,"This they said, tempting him, that they might have whereof to accuse him. But Jesus, having stooped down, was writing with his finger in the ground. ",selected_bible_verses
3028,"And as they continued asking him, raising himself up, he said to them: He that is without sin among you, let him first cast the stone at her. ",selected_bible_verses
3029,"And again stooping down, he wrote in the ground. ",selected_bible_verses
3030,"And they hearing it, and being convicted by their conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, unto the last; and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. ",selected_bible_verses
3031,"And Jesus raising himself up, and seeing none but the woman, said to her: Woman, where are they, thine accusers? Did no one condemn thee? ",selected_bible_verses
3032,"She said: No one, Lord. And Jesus said to her: Neither do I condemn thee; go, and sin no more.]  ",selected_bible_verses
3033,"Again therefore Jesus spoke to them, saying: I am the light of the world; he that follows me shall not walk in the darkness, but shall have the light of life. ",selected_bible_verses
3034,The Pharisees therefore said to him: Thou bearest witness of thyself; thy witness is not true. ,selected_bible_verses

3042,"Again therefore he said to them: I go away, and ye will seek me, and shall die in your sin. Whither I go, ye can not come. ",selected_bible_verses
3043,"The Jews therefore said: Will he kill himself? because he says: Whither I go, ye can not come. ",selected_bible_verses
3044,And he said to them: Ye are from beneath; I am from above. Ye are of this world; I am not of this world. ,selected_bible_verses
3045,"I said therefore to you, that ye shall die in your sins; for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins. ",selected_bible_verses
3046,Therefore they said to him: Who art thou? And Jesus said to them: That which I also say to you from the beginning. ,selected_bible_verses
3047,"I have many things to say and to judge concerning you. But he who sent me is true; and the things which I heard from him, these I speak to the world. ",selected_bible_verses

3050,And he who sent me is with me. He has not left me alone; because I do always the things that please him. ,selected_bible_verses
3051,As he spoke these words many believed on him.  ,selected_bible_verses
3052,"Jesus therefore said to those Jews who have believed him: If ye continue in my word, ye are truly my disciples; ",selected_bible_verses

3059,I speak what I have seen with my Father; and ye therefore do what ye have heard from your father.  ,selected_bible_verses
3060,"They answered and said to him: Our father is Abraham. Jesus says to them: If ye were children of Abraham, ye would do the works of Abraham. ",selected_bible_verses
3061,"But now ye seek to kill me, a man who has spoken to you the truth, which I heard from God. This Abraham did not. ",selected_bible_verses
3062,"Ye do the works of your father. They said to him: We were not born of fornication; we have one father, God. ",selected_bible_verses
3063,"Jesus said to them: If God were your father, ye would love me; for from God I came forth, and am come; neither have I come of myself, but he sent me. ",selected_bible_verses
3064,Why do ye not understand my speech? Because ye can not hear my word. ,selected_bible_verses
3065,"Ye are of your father the Devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abides not in the truth, because truth is not in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks of his own; because he is a liar, and the father of it. ",selected_bible_verses
3066,"And because I speak the truth, ye believe me not.  ",selected_bible_verses
3067,"Which of you convicts me of sin? If I speak truth, why do ye not believe me? ",selected_bible_verses
3068,"He that is of God hears God's words; ye therefore hear not, because ye are not of God.  ",selected_bible_verses
3069,"The Jews answered and said to him: Say we not well, that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a demon? ",selected_bible_verses
3070,"Jesus answered: I have not a demon; but I honor my Father, and ye dishonor me. ",selected_bible_verses
3071,"And I seek not my own glory; there is one that seeks, and judges. ",selected_bible_verses
3072,"Verily, verily, I say to you, if any one keep my saying, he shall not see death, forever. ",selected_bible_verses

3074,"Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who is dead? And the prophets are dead. Whom makest thou thyself? ",selected_bible_verses

3079,"Jesus said to them: Verily, verily, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am. ",selected_bible_verses
3080,"They took up stones therefore to cast at him. But Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple.    IX.  AND passing along, he saw a man blind from his birth. ",selected_bible_verses
3081,"And his disciples asked him, saying: Master, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he should be born blind? ",selected_bible_verses
3082,"Jesus answered: Neither this man sinned, nor his parents; but that the works of God should be made manifest in him. ",selected_bible_verses

3084,"As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.  ",selected_bible_verses
3085,"Having thus spoken, he spit on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay, ",selected_bible_verses
3086,"and said to him: Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which is interpreted, Sent). He went away therefore, and washed, and came seeing.  ",selected_bible_verses
3087,"The neighbors therefore, and they who before had seen him that he was a beggar, said: Is not this he that sits and begs? ",selected_bible_verses
3088,Some said: This is he; and others: He is like him; he said: I am he. ,selected_bible_verses
3089,Therefore they said to him: How were thine eyes opened? ,selected_bible_verses
3090,"He answered: A man called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said to me: Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash. And I went away and washed, and received sight. ",selected_bible_verses
3091,They said to him: Where is he? He said: I know not.  ,selected_bible_verses
3092,They bring to the Pharisees him who before was blind. ,selected_bible_verses
3093,"And it was the sabbath when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes. ",selected_bible_verses
3094,"Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him, how he received sight. He said to them: He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see. ",selected_bible_verses
3095,"Therefore some of the Pharisees said: This man is not from God, because he keeps not the sabbath. Others said: How can a man that is a sinner do such signs? And there was a division among them. ",selected_bible_verses
3096,"They say to the blind man again: What sayest thou of him, seeing that he opened thine eyes? He said: He is a Prophet.  ",selected_bible_verses
3097,"The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he was blind and received sight, until they called the parents of him that received sight. ",selected_bible_verses
3098,"And they asked them, saying: Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? How then does he now see? ",selected_bible_verses
3099,"His parents answered them and said: We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind. ",selected_bible_verses
3100,"But by what means he now sees, we know not; or who opened his eyes, we know not. He is of age; ask him. He shall speak for himself. ",selected_bible_verses
3101,"These words spoke his parents, because they feared the Jews; for the Jews had agreed already, that if any one acknowledged him as Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue. ",selected_bible_verses
3102,Therefore his parents said: He is of age; ask him.  ,selected_bible_verses
3103,"They therefore called a second time the man that was blind, and said to him: Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner. ",selected_bible_verses
3104,"He answered therefore: Whether he is a sinner, I know not; one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see. ",selected_bible_verses
3105,They therefore said to him: What did he to thee? How opened he thine eyes? ,selected_bible_verses
3106,"He answered them: I told you already, and ye did not hear. Wherefore would ye hear again? Will ye also become his disciples? ",selected_bible_verses
3107,"They reviled him, and said: Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples. ",selected_bible_verses
3108,"We know that God has spoken to Moses; but this man we know not, whence he is. ",selected_bible_verses
3109,"The man answered and said to them: Why herein is a marvelous thing, that ye know not whence he is, and he opened mine eyes. ",selected_bible_verses
3110,"Now we know that God hears not sinners. But if any one is a worshiper of God, and does his will, him he hears. ",selected_bible_verses
3111,"Since the world began, it was not heard that any one opened the eyes of one born blind. ",selected_bible_verses
3112,"If this man were not from God, he could do nothing. ",selected_bible_verses
3113,"They answered and said to him: Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.  ",selected_bible_verses
3114,"Jesus heard that they cast him out; and finding him, he said to him: Dost thou believe on the Son of God? ",selected_bible_verses
3115,"He answered and said: Who then is he, Lord, that I may believe on him? ",selected_bible_verses
3116,"And Jesus said to him: Thou hast both seen him, and he it is that talks with thee. ",selected_bible_verses
3117,"And he said: Lord, I believe. And he worshiped him.  ",selected_bible_verses
3118,"And Jesus said: For judgment came I into this world; that they who see not may see, and that they who see may become blind. ",selected_bible_verses
3119,"And some of the Pharisees who were with him heard these words, and said to him: Are we also blind? ",selected_bible_verses
3120,"Jesus said to them: If ye were blind, ye would not have sin. But now ye say: We see. Your sin remains!    X.  VERILY, verily, I say to you: He that enters not through the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber. ",selected_bible_verses
3121,But he that enters in through the door is a shepherd of the sheep. ,selected_bible_verses
3122,"To him the porter opens, and the sheep hear his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out. ",selected_bible_verses
3123,"And when he has put forth all his own, he goes before them; and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice. ",selected_bible_verses
3124,"And a stranger they will not follow, but will flee from him; because they know not the voice of strangers.  ",selected_bible_verses
3125,This parable spoke Jesus to them; but they understood not what things they were which he spoke to them.  ,selected_bible_verses
3126,"Therefore said Jesus to them again: Verily, verily, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep. ",selected_bible_verses
3127,All who came before me are thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not hear them. ,selected_bible_verses
3128,"I am the door. If any one enter in through me, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out and find pasture. ",selected_bible_verses
3129,"The thief comes not but to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I came that they may have life, and that they may have it abundantly.  ",selected_bible_verses
3130,I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. ,selected_bible_verses
3131,"But he that is a hireling, and not a shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep, and flees; and the wolf catches them, and scatters the sheep. ",selected_bible_verses
3132,"The hireling flees, because he is a hireling, and cares not for the sheep. ",selected_bible_verses
3133,"I am the good shepherd; and I know mine, and am known by mine, ",selected_bible_verses
3134,"as the Father knows me, and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep. ",selected_bible_verses
3135,"And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold. Them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one flock, one shepherd. ",selected_bible_verses
3136,"For this the Father loves me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again. ",selected_bible_verses
3137,"No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again. This commandment I received from my Father.  ",selected_bible_verses
3138,Again there arose a division among the Jews because of these words. ,selected_bible_verses
3139,"And many of them said: He has a demon, and is mad, why do ye hear him? ",selected_bible_verses
3140,Others said: These are not the words of one that has a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?  ,selected_bible_verses
3141,"And there came the feast of the dedication, in Jerusalem; and it was winter. ",selected_bible_verses
3142,"And Jesus was walking in the temple, in the porch of Solomon. ",selected_bible_verses
3143,"Jesus answered them: I told you, and ye do not believe. The works that I do in my Father's name, these bear witness of me. ",selected_bible_verses
3144,"But ye do not believe; for ye are not of my sheep, as I said to you. ",selected_bible_verses
3145,"My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me; ",selected_bible_verses
3146,"and I give to them eternal life; and they shall never perish, nor shall any one pluck them out of my hand. ",selected_bible_verses
3147,"My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; and no one is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand. ",selected_bible_verses
3148,I and the Father are one.  ,selected_bible_verses
3149,The Jews therefore took up stones again to stone him. ,selected_bible_verses
3150,Jesus answered them: Many good works have I showed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me? ,selected_bible_verses
3151,"The Jews answered him: For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy, and because thou, being man, makest thyself God. ",selected_bible_verses
3152,"Jesus answered them: Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods? ",selected_bible_verses
3153,"If he called them gods to whom the word of God came, and the Scripture can not be broken, ",selected_bible_verses
3154,"say ye of him, whom the Father sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God? ",selected_bible_verses
3155,"If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not. ",selected_bible_verses
3156,"But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works; that ye may learn and know, that the Father is in me, and I in the Father. ",selected_bible_verses
3157,"Therefore they sought again to seize him; and he went forth, out of their hand.  ",selected_bible_verses
3158,"And he went away again beyond the Jordan, to the place where John was at first immersing; and there he abode. ",selected_bible_verses
3159,"And many came to him, and said: John indeed wrought no sign; but all things that John spoke of this man were true. ",selected_bible_verses
3160,"And many believed on him there.    XI.  NOW a certain one was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, from the village of Mary and Martha her sister. ",selected_bible_verses
3161,"It was the Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick. ",selected_bible_verses
3162,"The sisters therefore sent to him, saying: Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick. ",selected_bible_verses
3163,"And Jesus hearing it, said: This sickness is not for death, but for the sake of the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified thereby.  ",selected_bible_verses
3164,"Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. ",selected_bible_verses
3165,"When therefore he heard that he was sick, he then abode two days in the place where he was. ",selected_bible_verses
3166,Then after this he says to the disciples: Let us go into Judaea again. ,selected_bible_verses
3167,"The disciples say to him: Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again? ",selected_bible_verses
3168,"Jesus answered: Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any one walk in the day, he stumbles not, because he sees the light of this world. ",selected_bible_verses
3169,"But if any one walk in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.  ",selected_bible_verses
3170,"These things said he; and after this he says to them: Lazarus our friend has fallen asleep; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep. ",selected_bible_verses
3171,"Therefore his disciples said: Lord if he has fallen asleep, he will be restored. ",selected_bible_verses
3172,But Jesus had spoken of his death; but they thought that he said it of taking rest in sleep. ,selected_bible_verses
3173,Then therefore Jesus said to them plainly: Lazarus is dead. ,selected_bible_verses
3174,"And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, that ye may believe. But let us go to him. ",selected_bible_verses
3175,"Therefore said Thomas, who is called Didymus, to his fellow disciples: Let us also go, that we may die with him.  ",selected_bible_verses
3176,"Having come therefore, Jesus found that he had already been four days in the tomb.  ",selected_bible_verses
3177,"Now Bethany was nigh to Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off. ",selected_bible_verses
3178,"And many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.  ",selected_bible_verses
3179,"Therefore Martha, when she heard that Jesus is coming, went and met him; but Mary sat in the house. ",selected_bible_verses
3180,"Then said Martha to Jesus: Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. ",selected_bible_verses
3181,"But even now, I know that whatever thou shalt ask of God, God will give it thee. ",selected_bible_verses
3182,Jesus says to her: Thy brother will rise again. ,selected_bible_verses
3183,"Martha says to him: I know that he will rise again, in the resurrection at the last day. ",selected_bible_verses
3184,"Jesus said to her: I am the resurrection, and the life; he that believes on me, though he be dead, yet shall he live; ",selected_bible_verses
3185,"and whoever lives and believes on me, shall never die. Believest thou this? ",selected_bible_verses
3186,"She says to him: Yea, Lord; I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, who comes into the world.  ",selected_bible_verses
3187,"And having said this, she went away, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying: The Teacher is come, and calls for thee. ",selected_bible_verses
3188,"And she, when she heard it, rises quickly and comes to him.  ",selected_bible_verses
3189,"Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was in the place where Martha met him. ",selected_bible_verses
3190,"The Jews therefore who were with her in the house and comforting her, when they saw that Mary rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying: She goes to the tomb to weep there.  ",selected_bible_verses
3191,"Mary therefore, when she came where Jesus was, seeing him, fell down at his feet, saying to him: Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.  ",selected_bible_verses
3192,"Jesus therefore, when he saw her weeping, and the Jews weeping who came with her, groaned in spirit, and was troubled. ",selected_bible_verses
3193,"And he said: Where have ye laid him? They say to him: Lord, come and see. ",selected_bible_verses
3194,Jesus wept.  ,selected_bible_verses
3195,The Jews therefore said: Behold how he loved him! ,selected_bible_verses
3196,"And some of them said: Could not this man, who opened the eyes of the blind, have caused even that this man should not have died? ",selected_bible_verses
3197,"Jesus therefore, again groaning in himself, comes to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.  ",selected_bible_verses
3198,"Jesus says: Take away the stone. The sister of him that was dead, Martha, says to him: Lord, by this time he is offensive; for he has been dead four days. ",selected_bible_verses
3199,"Jesus says to her: Said I not to thee, that, if thou believe, thou shalt see the glory of God?  ",selected_bible_verses
3200,"So they took away the stone. And Jesus raised his eyes upward, and said: Father, I thank thee that thou didst hear me. ",selected_bible_verses
3201,"And I knew that thou always hearest me; but for the sake of the multitude standing around I said it, that they might believe that thou didst send me. ",selected_bible_verses
3202,"And having thus spoken, he cried with a loud voice: Lazarus, come forth. ",selected_bible_verses
3203,"And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave clothes; and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus says to them: Loose him, and let him go.  ",selected_bible_verses
3204,"Many therefore of the Jews who came to Mary, and saw what he did, believed on him. ",selected_bible_verses
3205,"But some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them what Jesus did.  ",selected_bible_verses
3206,"Therefore the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said: What do we, seeing that this man works many signs? ",selected_bible_verses
3207,"If we let him thus alone, all will believe on him; and the Romans will come and take away both our place and nation. ",selected_bible_verses
3208,"And a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them: Ye know nothing; ",selected_bible_verses
3209,"nor do ye consider that it is expedient for us, that one man die for the people, and not the whole nation perish. ",selected_bible_verses
3210,"And this he spoke not of himself; but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation; ",selected_bible_verses
3211,"and not for the nation only, but that also he should gather together into one the children of God that were scattered abroad.  ",selected_bible_verses
3212,Therefore from that day forth they took counsel together to put him to death. ,selected_bible_verses
3213,"Jesus therefore no longer walked openly among the Jews; but departed thence to the country near to the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.  ",selected_bible_verses
3214,"And the passover of the Jews was at hand; and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country, before the passover, that they might purify themselves. ",selected_bible_verses
3215,"They sought therefore for Jesus, and said among themselves, as they stood in the temple: What think ye, that he will not come to the feast? ",selected_bible_verses
3216,"Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any one knew where he was, he should make it known, that they might seize him.    XII.  THEREFORE Jesus, six days before the passover, came to Bethany, where Lazarus was who had been dead, whom Jesus raised from the dead. ",selected_bible_verses
3217,"They therefore made him a supper there, and Martha served; and Lazarus was one of those who reclined at table with him.  ",selected_bible_verses
3218,"Then Mary took a pound of ointment of pure spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment. ",selected_bible_verses
3219,"Then says one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, who was about to betray him: ",selected_bible_verses
3220,For the poor ye have always with you; but me ye have not always.  ,selected_bible_verses
3221,"A great multitude of the Jews therefore knew that he was there. And they came, not because of Jesus only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he raised from the dead.  ",selected_bible_verses
3222,But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death; ,selected_bible_verses
3223,"because by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.  ",selected_bible_verses
3224,"On the morrow a great multitude that had come to the feast, hearing that Jesus is coming to Jerusalem, ",selected_bible_verses
3225,"took branches of the palm-trees and went forth to meet him, and cried: Hosanna; blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, the King of Israel. ",selected_bible_verses
3226,"And Jesus, having found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written:      ",selected_bible_verses
3227,"Fear not, daughter of Zion;     Behold, thy King comes,     Sitting on an ass's colt.  ",selected_bible_verses
3228,"These things his disciples understood not at the first. But when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of him, and that they did these things to him.  ",selected_bible_verses
3229,"The multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, bore witness. ",selected_bible_verses
3230,"For this the multitude also met him, because they heard that he had wrought this sign. ",selected_bible_verses
3231,"The Pharisees therefore said among themselves: Perceive ye that ye avail nothing? Behold, the world is gone after him.  ",selected_bible_verses
3232,"And there were certain Greeks, of those who come up to worship at the feast. ",selected_bible_verses
3233,"These came therefore to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying: Sir, we would see Jesus. ",selected_bible_verses
3234,Philip comes and tells Andrew; Andrew and Philip come and tell Jesus.  ,selected_bible_verses
3235,"And Jesus answered them, saying: The hour has come, that the Son of man should be glorified. ",selected_bible_verses
3236,"Verily, verily, I say to you, except the grain of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abides alone; but if it die, it brings forth much fruit. ",selected_bible_verses
3237,He that loves his life shall lose it; and he that hates his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal. ,selected_bible_verses
3238,"If any one serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be. If any one serve me, him will the Father honor.  ",selected_bible_verses
3239,"Father, glorify thy name. Then there came a voice out of heaven: I both have glorified it, and will glorify it again.  ",selected_bible_verses
3240,"The multitude therefore that stood by and heard, said that it thundered; others said: An angel has spoken to him. ",selected_bible_verses
3241,"Jesus answered and said: This voice came not for my sake, but for your sakes. ",selected_bible_verses
3242,Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the prince of this world be cast out. ,selected_bible_verses
3243,"And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to me. ",selected_bible_verses
3244,"This he said, signifying by what manner of death he should die.  ",selected_bible_verses
3245,The multitude answered him: We heard out of the law that the Christ abides forever; and how sayest thou: The Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man? ,selected_bible_verses
3246,"Jesus therefore said to them: Yet a little while is the light among you. Walk while ye have the light, that darkness may not overtake you; and he that walks in the darkness knows not whither he goes. ",selected_bible_verses
3247,"While ye have the light, believe on the light, that ye may become sons of light.  These things spoke Jesus, and departed, and hid himself from them.  ",selected_bible_verses
3248,"But though he had wrought so many signs before them, they did not believe on him; ",selected_bible_verses
3249,"that the saying of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke:      Lord, who believed our report,     And to whom was the arm of the Lord revealed?  ",selected_bible_verses
3250,"Therefore they could not believe, because Isaiah said again:      ",selected_bible_verses
3251,"He has blinded their eyes,     And has hardened their heart;     That they should not see with their eyes,     And understand with their heart,     And turn, and I should heal them.  ",selected_bible_verses
3252,"These things said Isaiah, because he saw his glory, and spoke of him. ",selected_bible_verses
3253,"Yet, even of the rulers many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not acknowledge him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue; ",selected_bible_verses
3254,for they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.  ,selected_bible_verses
3255,"And Jesus cried and said: He that believes on me, believes not on me but on him who sent me. ",selected_bible_verses
3256,And he that beholds me beholds him who sent me. ,selected_bible_verses
3257,"I have come a light into the world, that whoever believes on me may not abide in the darkness. ",selected_bible_verses
3258,"And if any one hear my words, and keep them not, I do not judge him; for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world. ",selected_bible_verses
3259,"He that rejects me, and receives not my words, has one that judges him. The word that I spokes that shall judge him in the last day. ",selected_bible_verses
3260,"Because I spoke not from myself; but the Father who sent me, he has given me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak. ",selected_bible_verses
3261,"And I know that his commandment is everlasting life. What things I speak therefore, as the Father has said to me, so I speak.    XIII.  AND before the feast of the passover, Jesus knowing that his hour has come that he should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, loved them to the end. ",selected_bible_verses
3262,"And supper being served, the Devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him; ",selected_bible_verses
3263,"knowing that the Father has given all things into his hands, and that he came out from God, and is going to God, ",selected_bible_verses
3264,"he rises from the supper, and lays aside his garments, and taking a towel he girded himself. ",selected_bible_verses
3265,"After that he pours water into the basin, and began to wash the feet of his disciples, and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded.  ",selected_bible_verses
3266,"He comes therefore to Simon Peter; and Peter says to him: Lord, dost thou wash my feet? ",selected_bible_verses
3267,Jesus answered and said to him: What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter. ,selected_bible_verses
3268,"Peter says to him: Never shalt thou wash my feet. Jesus answered him: If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me. ",selected_bible_verses
3269,"Simon Peter says to him: Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head. ",selected_bible_verses
3270,"Jesus says to him: He that has bathed has no need save to wash the feet, but is wholly clean. And ye are clean; but not all. ",selected_bible_verses
3271,For he knew his betrayer; therefore he said: Ye are not all clean.  ,selected_bible_verses
3272,"When therefore he had washed their feet, he took his garments, and reclining again at table, said to them: Know ye what I have done to you? ",selected_bible_verses
3273,"Ye call me the Teacher, and the Master; and ye say well, for so I am. ",selected_bible_verses
3274,"If I then, the Master and the Teacher, washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another's feet. ",selected_bible_verses
3275,"For I gave you an example, that as I did to you, ye also should do. ",selected_bible_verses
3276,"If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.  ",selected_bible_verses
3277,"I speak not of you all; I know whom I chose; but that the scripture might be fulfilled, He that eats the loaf with me lifted up his heel against me. ",selected_bible_verses
3278,"Even now I tell you, before it comes to pass, that when it comes to pass, ye may believe that I am he. ",selected_bible_verses
3279,"Verily, verily, I say to you, he that receives whomsoever I send receives me; and he that receives me receives him who sent me.  ",selected_bible_verses
3280,"Having said this, Jesus was troubled in spirit, and testified and said: Verily, verily, I say to you, that one of you will betray me. ",selected_bible_verses
3281,"The disciples therefore looked one on another, doubting of whom he spoke. ",selected_bible_verses
3282,"And there was reclining in Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved. ",selected_bible_verses
3283,"To him therefore Simon Peter beckons, and says to him: Say who it is of whom he speaks. ",selected_bible_verses
3284,"And he, leaning back on Jesus' breast, says to him: Lord, who is it? ",selected_bible_verses
3285,"Jesus answers: He it is, to whom I shall give the morsel, when I have dipped it. And having dipped the morsel, he gives it to Judas Iscariot, son of Simon. ",selected_bible_verses
3286,"And after the morsel, then entered Satan into him. Jesus therefore says to him: What thou doest, do quickly.  ",selected_bible_verses
3287,And no one at the table knew for what intent he spoke this to him. ,selected_bible_verses
3288,"For some thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus said to him: Buy what we need for the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.  ",selected_bible_verses
3289,"He then, having received the morsel, went immediately out; and it was night.  ",selected_bible_verses
3290,"When therefore he was gone out, Jesus says: Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him. ",selected_bible_verses
3291,"If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and will straightway glorify him. ",selected_bible_verses
3292,"Children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye will seek me; and as I said to the Jews, whither I go ye can not come, so now I say to you. ",selected_bible_verses
3293,"A new commandment I give to you, that ye love one another; as I loved you, that ye also love one another. ",selected_bible_verses
3294,"By this shall all know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one toward another.  ",selected_bible_verses
3295,"Simon Peter says to him: Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him: Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterward. ",selected_bible_verses
3296,"Peter says to him: Lord, why can not I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thee. ",selected_bible_verses
3297,"In my Father's house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you; because I go to prepare a place for you. ",selected_bible_verses
3298,"And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and will receive you to myself; that where I am ye may be also. ",selected_bible_verses
3299,And ye know the way whither I go.  ,selected_bible_verses
3300,"Thomas says to him: Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how do we know the way? ",selected_bible_verses
3301,"Jesus says to him: I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father, but by me. ",selected_bible_verses
3302,"If ye knew me, ye would know my Father also; and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.  ",selected_bible_verses
3303,"Philip says to him: Lord, show us the Father, and it suffices us. ",selected_bible_verses
3304,"Jesus says to him: Am I so long time with you, and dost thou not know me, Philip? He that has seen me has seen the Father; and how sayest thou: Show us the Father? ",selected_bible_verses
3305,"Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I speak to you I speak not of myself; but the Father who dwells in me, he does the works. ",selected_bible_verses
3306,"Believe me, that I am in the Father, and the Father in me; or else believe for the very works' sake.  ",selected_bible_verses
3307,"Verily, verily, I say to you, he that believes on me, the works that I do he shall do also, and greater than these shall he do, because I go to the Father. ",selected_bible_verses
3308,"And whatever ye shall ask in my name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. ",selected_bible_verses
3309,"If ye shall ask anything in my name, I will do it.  ",selected_bible_verses
3310,"If ye love me, keep my commandments. ",selected_bible_verses
3311,"And I will ask of the Father, and he will give you another Comforter, that he may be with you forever; ",selected_bible_verses
3312,"the Spirit of truth, whom the world can not receive, because it sees him not, neither knows him; but ye know him, because he abides with you, and shall be in you. ",selected_bible_verses
3313,"Yet a little while, and the world sees me no more; but ye see me; because I live, ye shall live also. ",selected_bible_verses
3314,"In that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you. ",selected_bible_verses
3315,"He that has my commandments, and keeps them, he it is that loves me; and he that loves me shall be loved by my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.  ",selected_bible_verses
3316,"Judas says to him (not Iscariot): Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself to us, and not to the world? ",selected_bible_verses
3317,"Jesus answered and said to him: If any one loves me, he will keep my word; and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our abode with him. ",selected_bible_verses
3318,"He that loves me not, keeps not my words; and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's who sent me.  ",selected_bible_verses
3319,"These things have I spoken to you, while abiding with you. ",selected_bible_verses
3320,"But the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all things which I said to you.  ",selected_bible_verses
3321,"Peace I leave with you, my peace I give to you; not as the world gives, give I to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. ",selected_bible_verses
3322,"Ye heard how I said to you: I go away; and I come to you. If ye loved me, ye would have rejoiced that I go to the Father; because the Father is greater than I. ",selected_bible_verses
3323,"And now I have told you before it comes to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe.  ",selected_bible_verses
3324,"I will no longer talk much with you; for the prince of the world comes, and in me he has nothing. ",selected_bible_verses

3333,"As the Father loved me, I also loved you; abide in my love. ",selected_bible_verses

3351,"And ye also shall bear witness, because ye are with me from the beginning.    XVI.  THESE things I have spoken to you, that ye should not be offended. ",selected_bible_verses
3352,"They will put you out of the synagogues; yea, a time is coming, that every one who kills you will think he makes an offering to God. ",selected_bible_verses
3353,"And these things they will do to you, because they have not known the Father, nor me. ",selected_bible_verses
3354,"But these things I have spoken to you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you. And these things I told you not from the beginning, because I was with you.  ",selected_bible_verses
3355,And now I go to him who sent me; and none of you asks me: Whither goest thou? ,selected_bible_verses
3356,"But because I have spoken these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart. ",selected_bible_verses
3357,"But I tell you the truth, it is expedient for you that I depart; for if I depart not, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you. ",selected_bible_verses
3358,"And when he is come, he will convict the world, in respect of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment; ",selected_bible_verses
3359,"of sin, in that they believe not on me; ",selected_bible_verses
3360,"of righteousness, in that I go to my Father, and ye behold me no more; ",selected_bible_verses
3361,"of judgment, in that the prince of this world has been judged.  ",selected_bible_verses
3362,"I have yet many things to say to you, but ye can not bear them now. ",selected_bible_verses
3363,"But when he, the Spirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak from himself, but whatever he shall hear, that will he speak, and he will tell you the things to come. ",selected_bible_verses
3364,"He will glorify me; because he will receive of mine, and will tell it to you. ",selected_bible_verses
3365,"All things that the Father has are mine. Therefore, I said, that he will receive of mine, and will tell it to you. ",selected_bible_verses
3366,"A little while, and ye behold me not; and again a little while, and ye shall see me.  ",selected_bible_verses
3367,"Therefore some of his disciples said to one another: What is this that he says to us, A little while, and ye behold me not; and again a little while, and ye shall see me; and, I go to the Father? ",selected_bible_verses
3368,"They said therefore: What is this that he says, A little while? We know not what he says.  ",selected_bible_verses
3369,"Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said to them: Do ye inquire of this with one another, that I said, A little while, and ye behold me not; and again a little while, and ye shall see me? ",selected_bible_verses
3370,"Verily, verily, I say to you, that ye will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; and ye will be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy. ",selected_bible_verses
3371,"A woman when she is in travail has sorrow, because her hour is come; but when she has borne the child, she remembers no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world. ",selected_bible_verses
3372,"And so ye now have sorrow; but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no one takes from you.  ",selected_bible_verses
3373,"And in that day ye shall ask nothing of me. Verily, verily, I say to you: Whatever ye shall ask of the Father, he will give it you in my name. ",selected_bible_verses
3374,"Hitherto ye asked nothing in my name. Ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be made full.  ",selected_bible_verses
3375,"These things I have spoken to you in parables. A time is coming, when I will no more speak to you in parables, but I will tell you plainly of the Father. ",selected_bible_verses
3376,"In that day ye shall ask in my name. And I say not to you, that I will pray the Father for you; ",selected_bible_verses
3377,"for the Father himself loves you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came forth from God. ",selected_bible_verses
3378,"I came forth from the Father, and have come into the world; again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.  ",selected_bible_verses
3379,"His disciples say to him: Lo, now thou speakest plainly, and speakest no parable. ",selected_bible_verses
3380,"Now we know that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any one should ask thee. By this we believe that thou camest forth from God.  ",selected_bible_verses
3381,Jesus answered them: Do ye now believe? ,selected_bible_verses
3382,"Behold, an hour is coming, and has come, that ye will be scattered, each one to his own, and will leave me alone; and I am not alone, because the Father is with me.  ",selected_bible_verses
3383,"These things I have spoken to you, that in me ye may have peace. In the world ye have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.    XVII.  THESE words spoke Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said: Father, the hour has come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son may glorify thee; ",selected_bible_verses
3384,"as thou gayest him authority over all flesh, that as many as thou hast given to him, to them he should give eternal life. ",selected_bible_verses
3385,"And this is the eternal life, that they know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou didst send. ",selected_bible_verses
3386,I glorified thee on the earth; I finished the work which thou hast given me to do. ,selected_bible_verses
3387,"And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was. ",selected_bible_verses

3408,"and I made known to them thy name, and will make it known; that the love wherewith thou lovedst me may be in them, and I in them.    XVIII.  HAVING spoken these words, Jesus went out with his disciples beyond the brook Kedron, where was a garden, into which he entered and his disciples. ",selected_bible_verses
3409,"And Judas also, his betrayer knew the place; because Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples.  ",selected_bible_verses
3410,"Judas therefore, having received the band and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, comes thither with torches and lamps and weapons. ",selected_bible_verses
3411,"Jesus therefore, knowing all the things that were coming upon him, went forth and said to them: Whom do ye seek? ",selected_bible_verses
3412,"They answered him: Jesus the Nazarene. Jesus says to them: I am he. And Judas also, his betrayer, was standing with them.  ",selected_bible_verses
3413,"When therefore he said to them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground.  ",selected_bible_verses
3414,Again therefore he asked them: Whom do ye seek? And they said: Jesus the Nazarene. ,selected_bible_verses
3415,"Jesus answered: I told you that I am he; if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way; ",selected_bible_verses
3416,"that the saying might be fulfilled, which he spoke: Of those whom thou hast given me, I lost none.  ",selected_bible_verses
3417,"Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus. ",selected_bible_verses
3418,"Jesus therefore said to Peter: Put up thy sword into the sheath. The cup which my Father has given me, shall I not drink it?  ",selected_bible_verses
3419,"So the band, and the captain, and the officers of the Jews, took Jesus and bound him, ",selected_bible_verses
3420,"and led him away to Annas first; for he was father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year. ",selected_bible_verses
3421,"And it was Caiaphas who counseled the Jews, that it is expedient that one man should die for the people.  ",selected_bible_verses
3422,"And Simon Peter and the other disciple followed Jesus. That disciple was known to the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the court of the high priest. ",selected_bible_verses
3423,"But Peter was standing at the door without. Therefore the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to her that kept the door, and brought in Peter. ",selected_bible_verses
3424,Then the damsel that kept the door says to Peter: Art not thou also one of this man's disciples? He says: I am not.  ,selected_bible_verses
3425,"And the servants and the officers were standing there, having made a fire of coals, because it was cold, and were warming themselves; and Peter was standing with them, and warming himself.  ",selected_bible_verses
3426,"The high priest therefore asked Jesus concerning his disciples, and concerning his teaching. ",selected_bible_verses
3427,"Jesus answered him: I have spoken openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, where all the Jews assemble; and I spoke nothing in secret. ",selected_bible_verses
3428,"Why askest thou me? Ask those who have heard, what I spoke to them. Behold, these know what things I said.  ",selected_bible_verses
3429,"And when he had said this, one of the officers who was standing by gave Jesus a blow on the face, saying: Answerest thou the high priest so? ",selected_bible_verses
3430,"Jesus answered him: If I spoke evil, bear witness of the evil; but if well, why dost thou smite me?  ",selected_bible_verses
3431,Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest. ,selected_bible_verses
3432,"And Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said therefore to him: Art thou also one of his disciples? He denied, and said: I am not. ",selected_bible_verses
3433,"One of the servants of the high priest, being a kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off, says: Did not I see thee in the garden with him? ",selected_bible_verses
3434,Again therefore Peter denied; and immediately a cock crowed.  ,selected_bible_verses
3435,"Then they lead Jesus from Caiaphas into the Governor's palace; and it was early; and they themselves went not into the palace, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the passover. ",selected_bible_verses
3436,"Pilate therefore went out to them, and said: What accusation do ye bring against this man? ",selected_bible_verses
3437,"They answered and said to him: If this man were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up to thee. ",selected_bible_verses
3438,"Pilate therefore said to them: Do ye take him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said to him: It is not lawful for us to put any one to death; ",selected_bible_verses
3439,"that the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying by what manner of death he should die.  ",selected_bible_verses
3440,"Pilate therefore entered into the palace again, and called Jesus, and said to him: Art thou the King of the Jews? ",selected_bible_verses
3441,"Jesus answered: Dost thou say this of thyself, or did others tell thee concerning me? ",selected_bible_verses
3442,"Pilate answered: Am I a Jew? Thine own nation, and the chief priests, delivered thee up to me. What didst thou? ",selected_bible_verses
3443,"Jesus answered: My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would fight, that I might not be delivered up to the Jews; but now is my kingdom not from hence. ",selected_bible_verses
3444,"Pilate therefore said to him: Art thou a king then? Jesus answered: Thou sayest it; because I am a king. To this end have I been born, and to this end have I come into the world, that I may bear witness to the truth. Every one that is of the truth hears my voice.  ",selected_bible_verses
3445,"Pilate says to him: What is truth? And having said this, he went out again to the Jews, and says to them: I find no fault in him. ",selected_bible_verses
3446,"But ye have a custom, that I should release to you one at the passover. Do ye desire therefore that I release to you the King of the Jews? ",selected_bible_verses
3447,"They all therefore cried out again, saying: Not this one, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.    XIX.  THEN therefore Pilate took Jesus, and scourged him. ",selected_bible_verses
3448,"And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and put on him a purple robe; and they came to him, ",selected_bible_verses
3449,"and said: Hail, King of the Jews! And they gave him blows on the face.  ",selected_bible_verses
3450,"Pilate went forth again, and says to them: Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him. ",selected_bible_verses
3451,"Jesus therefore came forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And he says to them: Behold the man!  ",selected_bible_verses
3452,"When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, saying: Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate says to them: Do ye take him, and crucify him; for I find no fault in him. ",selected_bible_verses
3453,"The Jews answered him: We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.  ",selected_bible_verses
3454,"When therefore Pilate heard this saying, he was the more afraid. ",selected_bible_verses
3455,"And he went again into the palace, and says to Jesus: Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer. ",selected_bible_verses
3456,"Then says Pilate to him: Dost thou not speak to me? Knowest thou not that I have power to release thee, and have power to crucify thee? ",selected_bible_verses
3457,"Jesus answered: Thou wouldst have no power against me, except it were given thee from above. Therefore he that delivers me to thee has the greater sin. ",selected_bible_verses
3458,"Thenceforth Pilate sought to release him. But the Jews cried out, saying: If thou let this man go, thou art not a friend of Caesar. Whoever makes himself a king speaks against Caesar.  ",selected_bible_verses
3459,"When therefore Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down on the judgment-seat in a place called the Pavement, and in Hebrew, Gabbatha. ",selected_bible_verses
3460,"And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour. And he says to the Jews: Behold your king! ",selected_bible_verses
3461,"But they cried out: Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate says to them: Shall I crucify your king? The chief priests answered: We have no king but Caesar. ",selected_bible_verses
3462,"Then therefore he delivered him to them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away.  ",selected_bible_verses
3463,"And bearing his cross he went forth into the place called Place of a skull, which in Hebrew is called Golgotha; ",selected_bible_verses
3464,"where they crucified him, and two others with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst. ",selected_bible_verses
3465,"And Pilate wrote also a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was: JESUS THE NAZARENE THE KING OF THE JEWS.  ",selected_bible_verses
3466,"This title therefore many of the Jews read; because the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city, and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin. ",selected_bible_verses
3467,"Therefore said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate: Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. ",selected_bible_verses
3468,"Pilate answered: What I have written, I have written.  ",selected_bible_verses
3469,"Then the soldiers, when they crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part, and also his coat. And the coat was without a seam, woven from the top throughout. ",selected_bible_verses
3470,"They said therefore to one another: Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be; that the scripture might be fulfilled which says:      They parted my garments among them.     And for my vesture they cast lots.  These things the soldiers did. ",selected_bible_verses
3471,"And there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary the Magdalene. ",selected_bible_verses
3472,"Jesus therefore seeing his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing by, says to his mother: Woman, behold thy son! ",selected_bible_verses
3473,Then he says to the disciple: Behold thy mother! And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home.  ,selected_bible_verses
3474,"After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now finished, that the scripture might be accomplished, says: I thirst. ",selected_bible_verses
3475,"Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar; and they, having filled a sponge with vinegar, and put it on a hyssop-stalk, bore it to his mouth. ",selected_bible_verses
3476,"When Jesus therefore received the vinegar, he said: It is finished; and he bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.  ",selected_bible_verses
3477,"The Jews therefore, since it was the preparation, that the bodies might not remain upon the cross on the sabbath (for that sabbath day was a great day), besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and they be taken away. ",selected_bible_verses
3478,"The soldiers came, therefore, and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified with him. ",selected_bible_verses
3479,"But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was already dead, they broke not his legs. ",selected_bible_verses
3480,"But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith there came out blood and water.  ",selected_bible_verses
3481,"And he that has seen has borne witness, and his witness is true, and he knows that he says what is true, that ye also might believe. ",selected_bible_verses
3482,"For these things came to pass, that the scripture might be fulfilled: A bone of him shall not be broken. ",selected_bible_verses
3483,And again another scripture says: They shall look on him whom they pierced.  ,selected_bible_verses
3484,"And after this, Joseph from Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took away the body of Jesus. ",selected_bible_verses
3485,"And there came also Nicodemus, who at the first came to Jesus by night, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds weight. ",selected_bible_verses
3486,"They took therefore the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen cloths with the spices, as is the custom of the Jews to prepare for burial.  ",selected_bible_verses
3487,"And in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein no one was yet laid. ",selected_bible_verses
3488,"There they laid Jesus therefore, on account of the preparation of the Jews, because the sepulchre was nigh at hand.    XX.  AND on the first day of the week Mary the Magdalene comes early, while it is yet dark, to the sepulchre, and sees the stone taken away out of the sepulchre. ",selected_bible_verses
3489,"She runs therefore and comes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and says to them: They took away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they laid him.  ",selected_bible_verses
3490,"Peter therefore went forth, and the other disciple, and they went to the sepulchre. ",selected_bible_verses
3491,"And the two ran together; and the other disciple outran Peter, and came first to the sepulchre. ",selected_bible_verses
3492,And stooping down he sees the linen cloths lying; yet he went not in. ,selected_bible_verses
3493,"Then comes Simon Peter following him; and he went into the sepulchre, and sees the linen cloths lying, ",selected_bible_verses
3494,"and the napkin that was about his head not lying with the linen cloths, but wrapped together in a place by itself. ",selected_bible_verses
3495,"Then therefore the other disciple, who came first to the sepulchre, went in also; and he saw, and believed. ",selected_bible_verses
3496,"For not even yet did they know the scripture, that he must rise from the dead.  ",selected_bible_verses
3497,The disciples therefore went away again to their own home. ,selected_bible_verses
3498,"And Mary was standing by the sepulchre without, weeping. So, as she wept, she stooped clown into the sepulchre, ",selected_bible_verses
3499,"and beholds two angels in white, sitting the one at the head and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus lay. ",selected_bible_verses
3500,"And they say to her: Woman, why weepest thou? She says to them: Because they took away my Lord, and I know not where they laid him.  ",selected_bible_verses
3501,"Having said this, she turned back and beholds Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus. ",selected_bible_verses
3502,"Jesus says to her: Woman, why weepest thou? Whom dost thou seek? She, supposing that it was the gardener, says to him: Sir, if thou didst bear him hence, tell me where thou laidest him, and I will take him away. ",selected_bible_verses
3503,"Jesus says to her: Mary! Turning, she says to him in Hebrew: Rabboni! (which is to say, Teacher!) ",selected_bible_verses
3504,"Jesus says to her: Touch me not; for I have not yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brethren, and say to them: I ascend to my Father and your Father, and my God and your God.  ",selected_bible_verses
3505,"Mary the Magdalene comes bringing word to the disciples, that she has seen the Lord, and that he spoke these things to her.  ",selected_bible_verses
3506,"When therefore it was evening on that day, the first day of the week, the doors having been shut, where the disciples were assembled, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst; and he says to them: Peace be to you. ",selected_bible_verses
3507,"And having said this, he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples rejoiced therefore, when they saw the Lord.  ",selected_bible_verses
3508,"Jesus therefore said to them again: Peace be to you. As the Father has sent me, I also send you. ",selected_bible_verses
3509,"And having said this, he breathed on them, and says to them: Receive the Holy Spirit. ",selected_bible_verses
3510,"Whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them; and whosesoever ye retain, they are retained.  ",selected_bible_verses
3511,"But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. ",selected_bible_verses
3512,"The other disciples therefore said to him: We have seen the Lord. But he said to them: Except I see in his hands the print of the nails, and thrust my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.  ",selected_bible_verses
3513,"And after eight days, again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them. Jesus comes, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said: Peace be to you. ",selected_bible_verses
3514,"After that, he says to Thomas: Reach hither thy finger, and see my hands; and reach thy hand, and thrust it into my side; and be not faithless, but believing. ",selected_bible_verses
3515,"Thomas answered and said to him: My Lord, and my God. ",selected_bible_verses
3516,"Jesus says to him: Because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed. Happy they who saw not, and have believed!  ",selected_bible_verses
3517,"Many other signs also did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book. ",selected_bible_verses
3518,"But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye may have life in his name.    XXI.  AFTER these things Jesus manifested himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and he manifested himself in this manner.  ",selected_bible_verses
3519,"There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael from Cana of Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples. ",selected_bible_verses
3520,"Simon Peter says to them: I go a fishing. They say to him: We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into the ship; and in that night they caught nothing.  ",selected_bible_verses
3521,"But when morning was now come, Jesus stood on the beach; yet the disciples knew not that it was Jesus. ",selected_bible_verses
3522,"Jesus therefore says to them: Children, have ye anything to eat? They answered him: No. ",selected_bible_verses
3523,"And he said to them: Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast it therefore; and now they were not able to draw it, for the multitude of the fishes.  ",selected_bible_verses
3524,"Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved says to Peter: It is the Lord. Simon Peter therefore, hearing that it is the Lord, girded on his outer garment (for he was naked), and cast himself into the sea. ",selected_bible_verses
3525,"And the other disciples came in the boat (for they were not far from land, but about two hundred cubits off), dragging the net with the fishes.  ",selected_bible_verses
3526,"When therefore they went out upon the land, they see a fire of coals there, and a fish lying thereon, and bread. ",selected_bible_verses
3527,Jesus says to them: Bring of the fishes which ye just now caught. ,selected_bible_verses
3528,"Simon Peter went on board, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty and three; and though there were so many, the net was not broken.  ",selected_bible_verses
3529,"Jesus says to them: Come hither, and break your fast. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it is the Lord. ",selected_bible_verses

3531,"This the third time already, Jesus manifested himself to his disciples, after he was risen from the dead.  ",selected_bible_verses
3532,"When therefore they had broken their fast, Jesus says to Simon Peter: Simon, son of Jonah, lovest thou me more than these? He says to him: Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He says to him: Feed my lambs.  ",selected_bible_verses

3536,"And this he spoke, signifying by what manner of death he should glorify God.  And having spoken this, he says to him: Follow me. ",selected_bible_verses
3537,"Peter, turning about, sees the disciple whom Jesus loved following; who also at the supper leaned back on his breast, and said: Lord, who is he that betrays thee? ",selected_bible_verses
3538,"Peter seeing him says to Jesus: Lord, and what shall this man do? ",selected_bible_verses
3539,"Jesus says to him: If I will that he remain till I come, what is it to thee? Do thou follow me.  ",selected_bible_verses

119,"But Peter said, ""Anani'as, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back part of the proceeds of the land?",acts
120,"While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own? And after it was sold, was it not at your disposal? How is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to men but to God.""",acts
121,"When Anani'as heard these words, he fell down and died. And great fear came upon all who heard of it.",acts
122,The young men rose and wrapped him up and carried him out and buried him.,acts
123,"And Peter said to her, ""Tell me whether you sold the land for so much."" And she said, ""Yes, for so much.""",acts
124,"But Peter said to her, ""How is it that you have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Hark, the feet of those that have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out.""",acts
125,"Immediately she fell down at his feet and died. When the young men came in they found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her beside her husband.",acts
126,"And great fear came upon the whole church, and upon all who heard of these things.",acts
127,"None of the rest dared join them, but the people held them in high honor.",acts
128,"And more than ever believers were added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women,",acts
129,"so that they even carried out the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and pallets, that as Peter came by at least his shadow might fall on some of them.",acts
130,"The people also gathered from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing the sick and those afflicted with unclean spirits, and they were all healed.",acts
131,they arrested the apostles and put them in the common prison.,acts
132,"But at night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out and said,",acts
133,"""Go and stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this Life.""",acts
134,"And when they heard this, they entered the temple at daybreak and taught.",acts
135,"But when the officers came, they did not find them in the prison, and they returned and reported,",acts
136,"""We found the prison securely locked and the sentries standing at the doors, but when we opened it we found no one inside.""",acts
137,"Now when the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words, they were much perplexed about them, wondering what this would come to.",acts
138,"And some one came and told them, ""The men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people.""",acts
139,"Then the captain with the officers went and brought them, but without violence, for they were afraid of being stoned by the people.",acts
140,"saying, ""We strictly charged you not to teach in this name, yet here you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and you intend to bring this man's blood upon us.""",acts
141,"But Peter and the apostles answered, ""We must obey God rather than men.",acts
142,The God of our fathers raised Jesus whom you killed by hanging him on a tree.,acts
143,"God exalted him at his right hand as Leader and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.",acts
144,"And we are witnesses to these things, and so is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey him.""",acts
145,"But a Pharisee in the council named Gama'li-el, a teacher of the law, held in honor by all the people, stood up and ordered the men to be put outside for a while.",acts
146,"And he said to them, ""Men of Israel, take care what you do with these men.",acts
147,"For before these days Theu'das arose, giving himself out to be somebody, and a number of men, about four hundred, joined him; but he was slain and all who followed him were dispersed and came to nothing.",acts
148,"After him Judas the Galilean arose in the days of the census and drew away some of the people after him; he also perished, and all who followed him were scattered.",acts
149,"So in the present case I tell you, keep away from these men and let them alone; for if this plan or this undertaking is of men, it will fail;",acts

151,"Then they left the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name.",acts

153,"And the twelve summoned the body of the disciples and said, ""It is not right that we should give up preaching the word of God to serve tables.",acts
154,"Therefore, brethren, pick out from among you seven men of good repute, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint to this duty.",acts
155,"But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.""",acts
156,"And what they said pleased the whole multitude, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Proch'orus, and Nica'nor, and Ti'mon, and Par'menas, and Nicola'us, a proselyte of Antioch.",acts
157,"These they set before the apostles, and they prayed and laid their hands upon them.",acts
158,"Then some of those who belonged to the synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called), and of the Cyre'nians, and of the Alexandrians, and of those from Cili'cia and Asia, arose and disputed with Stephen.",acts
159,But they could not withstand the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke.,acts
160,"Then they secretly instigated men, who said, ""We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.""",acts
161,"And they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes, and they came upon him and seized him and brought him before the council,",acts
162,"and set up false witnesses who said, ""This man never ceases to speak words against this holy place and the law;",acts
163,"for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place, and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us.""",acts
164,"And gazing at him, all who sat in the council saw that his face was like the face of an angel.",acts
165,"And Stephen said: ""Brethren and fathers, hear me. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopota'mia, before he lived in Haran,",acts
166,"and said to him, `Depart from your land and from your kindred and go into the land which I will show you.'",acts
167,"Then he departed from the land of the Chalde'ans, and lived in Haran. And after his father died, God removed him from there into this land in which you are now living;",acts
168,"yet he gave him no inheritance in it, not even a foot's length, but promised to give it to him in possession and to his posterity after him, though he had no child.",acts
169,"And God spoke to this effect, that his posterity would be aliens in a land belonging to others, who would enslave them and ill-treat them four hundred years.",acts
170,"`But I will judge the nation which they serve,' said God, `and after that they shall come out and worship me in this place.'",acts
171,"And he gave him the covenant of circumcision. And so Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob of the twelve patriarchs.",acts
172,"and rescued him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who made him governor over Egypt and over all his household.",acts
173,"Now there came a famine throughout all Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction, and our fathers could find no food.",acts
174,"But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent forth our fathers the first time.",acts
175,"And at the second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Joseph's family became known to Pharaoh.",acts
176,"And Joseph sent and called to him Jacob his father and all his kindred, seventy-five souls;",acts
177,"and Jacob went down into Egypt. And he died, himself and our fathers,",acts
178,and they were carried back to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a sum of silver from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.,acts
179,till there arose over Egypt another king who had not known Joseph.,acts
180,"He dealt craftily with our race and forced our fathers to expose their infants, that they might not be kept alive.",acts
181,"At this time Moses was born, and was beautiful before God. And he was brought up for three months in his father's house;",acts
182,"and when he was exposed, Pharaoh's daughter adopted him and brought him up as her own son.",acts
183,"And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was mighty in his words and deeds.",acts
184,"And seeing one of them being wronged, he defended the oppressed man and avenged him by striking the Egyptian.",acts
185,"He supposed that his brethren understood that God was giving them deliverance by his hand, but they did not understand.",acts
186,"And on the following day he appeared to them as they were quarreling and would have reconciled them, saying, `Men, you are brethren, why do you wrong each other?'",acts
187,"But the man who was wronging his neighbor thrust him aside, saying, `Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?",acts
188,Do you want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?',acts
189,"At this retort Moses fled, and became an exile in the land of Mid'ian, where he became the father of two sons.",acts
190,"When Moses saw it he wondered at the sight; and as he drew near to look, the voice of the Lord came,",acts
191,"`I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob.' And Moses trembled and did not dare to look.",acts
192,"And the Lord said to him, `Take off the shoes from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.",acts
193,"I have surely seen the ill-treatment of my people that are in Egypt and heard their groaning, and I have come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send you to Egypt.'",acts
194,"He led them out, having performed wonders and signs in Egypt and at the Red Sea, and in the wilderness for forty years.",acts
195,"This is the Moses who said to the Israelites, `God will raise up for you a prophet from your brethren as he raised me up.'",acts
196,"This is he who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him at Mount Sinai, and with our fathers; and he received living oracles to give to us.",acts
197,"Our fathers refused to obey him, but thrust him aside, and in their hearts they turned to Egypt,",acts
198,"saying to Aaron, `Make for us gods to go before us; as for this Moses who led us out from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.'",acts
199,"And they made a calf in those days, and offered a sacrifice to the idol and rejoiced in the works of their hands.",acts
200,"But God turned and gave them over to worship the host of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets: `Did you offer to me slain beasts and sacrifices,",acts
201,"And you took up the tent of Moloch,",acts
202,"Our fathers in turn brought it in with Joshua when they dispossessed the nations which God thrust out before our fathers. So it was until the days of David,",acts
203,who found favor in the sight of God and asked leave to find a habitation for the God of Jacob.,acts
204,But it was Solomon who built a house for him.,acts
205,"Yet the Most High does not dwell in houses made with hands; as the prophet says,",acts
206,"`Heaven is my throne,",acts
207,Did not my hand make all these things?',acts
208,"Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute? And they killed those who announced beforehand the coming of the Righteous One, whom you have now betrayed and murdered,",acts
209,"you who received the law as delivered by angels and did not keep it.""",acts
210,"But he, full of the Holy Spirit, gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God;",acts
211,"and he said, ""Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God.""",acts
212,But they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and rushed together upon him.,acts
213,Then they cast him out of the city and stoned him; and the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul.,acts
214,"And as they were stoning Stephen, he prayed, ""Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.""",acts
215,"And he knelt down and cried with a loud voice, ""Lord, do not hold this sin against them."" And when he had said this, he fell asleep.",acts
216,"Devout men buried Stephen, and made great lamentation over him.",acts
217,"But Saul was ravaging the church, and entering house after house, he dragged off men and women and committed them to prison.",acts
218,"Philip went down to a city of Sama'ria, and proclaimed to them the Christ.",acts
219,"And the multitudes with one accord gave heed to what was said by Philip, when they heard him and saw the signs which he did.",acts
220,"For unclean spirits came out of many who were possessed, crying with a loud voice; and many who were paralyzed or lame were healed.",acts
221,So there was much joy in that city.,acts
222,"They all gave heed to him, from the least to the greatest, saying, ""This man is that power of God which is called Great.""",acts
223,"And they gave heed to him, because for a long time he had amazed them with his magic.",acts
224,"But when they believed Philip as he preached good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.",acts
225,"Even Simon himself believed, and after being baptized he continued with Philip. And seeing signs and great miracles performed, he was amazed.",acts
226,who came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit;,acts
227,"for it had not yet fallen on any of them, but they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.",acts
228,Then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit.,acts
229,"Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money,",acts
230,"saying, ""Give me also this power, that any one on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.""",acts
231,"But Peter said to him, ""Your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money!",acts
232,"You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart is not right before God.",acts
233,"Repent therefore of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that, if possible, the intent of your heart may be forgiven you.",acts
234,"For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity.""",acts
235,"And Simon answered, ""Pray for me to the Lord, that nothing of what you have said may come upon me.""",acts
236,"And he rose and went. And behold, an Ethiopian, a eunuch, a minister of the Can'dace, queen of the Ethiopians, in charge of all her treasure, had come to Jerusalem to worship",acts
237,"and was returning; seated in his chariot, he was reading the prophet Isaiah.",acts
238,"And the Spirit said to Philip, ""Go up and join this chariot.""",acts
239,"So Philip ran to him, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and asked, ""Do you understand what you are reading?""",acts
240,"And he said, ""How can I, unless some one guides me?"" And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.",acts
241,"Now the passage of the scripture which he was reading was this: ""As a sheep led to the slaughter",acts
242,In his humiliation justice was denied him.,acts
243,"And the eunuch said to Philip, ""About whom, pray, does the prophet say this, about himself or about some one else?""",acts
244,"Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning with this scripture he told him the good news of Jesus.",acts
245,"And as they went along the road they came to some water, and the eunuch said, ""See, here is water! What is to prevent my being baptized?""",acts
246,"And he commanded the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water, Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.",acts
247,"And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught up Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more, and went on his way rejoicing.",acts
248,"But Philip was found at Azo'tus, and passing on he preached the gospel to all the towns till he came to Caesare'a.",acts
249,"and asked him for letters to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any belonging to the Way, men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.",acts
250,"Now as he journeyed he approached Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed about him.",acts
251,"And he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, ""Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?""",acts
252,"And he said, ""Who are you, Lord?"" And he said, ""I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting;",acts
253,"but rise and enter the city, and you will be told what you are to do.""",acts
254,"The men who were traveling with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one.",acts
255,"Saul arose from the ground; and when his eyes were opened, he could see nothing; so they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus.",acts
256,"And for three days he was without sight, and neither ate nor drank.",acts
257,"And the Lord said to him, ""Rise and go to the street called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for a man of Tarsus named Saul; for behold, he is praying,",acts
258,"and he has seen a man named Anani'as come in and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight.""",acts
259,"But Anani'as answered, ""Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he has done to thy saints at Jerusalem;",acts
260,"and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call upon thy name.""",acts
261,"But the Lord said to him, ""Go, for he is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel;",acts
262,"for I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name.""",acts
263,"So Anani'as departed and entered the house. And laying his hands on him he said, ""Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus who appeared to you on the road by which you came, has sent me that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.""",acts
264,"And immediately something like scales fell from his eyes and he regained his sight. Then he rose and was baptized,",acts
265,and took food and was strengthened.,acts
266,"And in the synagogues immediately he proclaimed Jesus, saying, ""He is the Son of God.""",acts
267,"And all who heard him were amazed, and said, ""Is not this the man who made havoc in Jerusalem of those who called on this name? And he has come here for this purpose, to bring them bound before the chief priests.""",acts
268,"But Saul increased all the more in strength, and confounded the Jews who lived in Damascus by proving that Jesus was the Christ.",acts
269,"but their plot became known to Saul. They were watching the gates day and night, to kill him;",acts
270,"but his disciples took him by night and let him down over the wall, lowering him in a basket.",acts
271,"But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared to them how on the road he had seen the Lord, who spoke to him, and how at Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of Jesus.",acts
272,"So he went in and out among them at Jerusalem,",acts
273,preaching boldly in the name of the Lord. And he spoke and disputed against the Hellenists; but they were seeking to kill him.,acts
274,"And when the brethren knew it, they brought him down to Caesare'a, and sent him off to Tarsus.",acts
275,"There he found a man named Aene'as, who had been bedridden for eight years and was paralyzed.",acts
276,"And Peter said to him, ""Aene'as, Jesus Christ heals you; rise and make your bed."" And immediately he rose.",acts
277,"And all the residents of Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.",acts
278,"In those days she fell sick and died; and when they had washed her, they laid her in an upper room.",acts
279,"Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men to him entreating him, ""Please come to us without delay.""",acts
280,"So Peter rose and went with them. And when he had come, they took him to the upper room. All the widows stood beside him weeping, and showing tunics and other garments which Dorcas made while she was with them.",acts
281,"But Peter put them all outside and knelt down and prayed; then turning to the body he said, ""Tabitha, rise."" And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter she sat up.",acts
282,And he gave her his hand and lifted her up. Then calling the saints and widows he presented her alive.,acts
283,"And it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.",acts
284,"And he stayed in Joppa for many days with one Simon, a tanner.",acts
285,"a devout man who feared God with all his household, gave alms liberally to the people, and prayed constantly to God.",acts
286,"About the ninth hour of the day he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God coming in and saying to him, ""Cornelius.""",acts
287,"And he stared at him in terror, and said, ""What is it, Lord?"" And he said to him, ""Your prayers and your alms have ascended as a memorial before God.",acts
288,"And now send men to Joppa, and bring one Simon who is called Peter;",acts
289,"he is lodging with Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the seaside.""",acts
290,"When the angel who spoke to him had departed, he called two of his servants and a devout soldier from among those that waited on him,",acts
291,"and having related everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.",acts
292,"And he became hungry and desired something to eat; but while they were preparing it, he fell into a trance",acts
293,"and saw the heaven opened, and something descending, like a great sheet, let down by four corners upon the earth.",acts
294,In it were all kinds of animals and reptiles and birds of the air.,acts
295,"And there came a voice to him, ""Rise, Peter; kill and eat.""",acts
296,"But Peter said, ""No, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean.""",acts
297,"And the voice came to him again a second time, ""What God has cleansed, you must not call common.""",acts
298,"This happened three times, and the thing was taken up at once to heaven.",acts
299,and called out to ask whether Simon who was called Peter was lodging there.,acts
300,"And while Peter was pondering the vision, the Spirit said to him, ""Behold, three men are looking for you.",acts
301,"Rise and go down, and accompany them without hesitation; for I have sent them.""",acts
302,"And Peter went down to the men and said, ""I am the one you are looking for; what is the reason for your coming?""",acts
303,"And they said, ""Cornelius, a centurion, an upright and God-fearing man, who is well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, was directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house, and to hear what you have to say.""",acts
304,So he called them in to be his guests.,acts
305,And on the following day they entered Caesare'a. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his kinsmen and close friends.,acts
306,"When Peter entered, Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshiped him.",acts
307,"But Peter lifted him up, saying, ""Stand up; I too am a man.""",acts
308,"And as he talked with him, he went in and found many persons gathered;",acts
309,"and he said to them, ""You yourselves know how unlawful it is for a Jew to associate with or to visit any one of another nation; but God has shown me that I should not call any man common or unclean.",acts
310,"So when I was sent for, I came without objection. I ask then why you sent for me.""",acts
311,"saying, `Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before God.",acts
312,"Send therefore to Joppa and ask for Simon who is called Peter; he is lodging in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the seaside.'",acts
313,"So I sent to you at once, and you have been kind enough to come. Now therefore we are all here present in the sight of God, to hear all that you have been commanded by the Lord.""",acts
314,but in every nation any one who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him.,acts
315,"You know the word which he sent to Israel, preaching good news of peace by Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all),",acts
316,"the word which was proclaimed throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism which John preached:",acts
317,"how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power; how he went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.",acts
318,And we are witnesses to all that he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree;,acts
319,but God raised him on the third day and made him manifest;,acts
320,"not to all the people but to us who were chosen by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.",acts
321,"And he commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that he is the one ordained by God to be judge of the living and the dead.",acts
322,"To him all the prophets bear witness that every one who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.""",acts
323,"And the believers from among the circumcised who came with Peter were amazed, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles.",acts
324,"For they heard them speaking in tongues and extolling God. Then Peter declared,",acts
325,"""Can any one forbid water for baptizing these people who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?""",acts
326,And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to remain for some days.,acts
327,"So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcision party criticized him,",acts
328,"saying, ""Why did you go to uncircumcised men and eat with them?""",acts
329,But Peter began and explained to them in order:,acts
330,"""I was in the city of Joppa praying; and in a trance I saw a vision, something descending, like a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came down to me.",acts
331,Looking at it closely I observed animals and beasts of prey and reptiles and birds of the air.,acts
332,"And I heard a voice saying to me, `Rise, Peter; kill and eat.'",acts
333,"But I said, `No, Lord; for nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth.'",acts
334,"But the voice answered a second time from heaven, `What God has cleansed you must not call common.'",acts
335,"This happened three times, and all was drawn up again into heaven.",acts
336,"At that very moment three men arrived at the house in which we were, sent to me from Caesare'a.",acts
337,"And the Spirit told me to go with them, making no distinction. These six brethren also accompanied me, and we entered the man's house.",acts
338,"And he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying, `Send to Joppa and bring Simon called Peter;",acts
339,"he will declare to you a message by which you will be saved, you and all your household.'",acts
340,"As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them just as on us at the beginning.",acts
341,"And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, `John baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.'",acts
342,"If then God gave the same gift to them as he gave to us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could withstand God?""",acts
343,"When they heard this they were silenced. And they glorified God, saying, ""Then to the Gentiles also God has granted repentance unto life.""",acts
344,"But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyre'ne, who on coming to Antioch spoke to the Greeks also, preaching the Lord Jesus.",acts
345,"And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number that believed turned to the Lord.",acts
346,"News of this came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.",acts
347,"When he came and saw the grace of God, he was glad; and he exhorted them all to remain faithful to the Lord with steadfast purpose;",acts
348,"for he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a large company was added to the Lord.",acts
349,So Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul;,acts
350,"and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year they met with the church, and taught a large company of people; and in Antioch the disciples were for the first time called Christians.",acts
351,And one of them named Ag'abus stood up and foretold by the Spirit that there would be a great famine over all the world; and this took place in the days of Claudius.,acts
352,"And the disciples determined, every one according to his ability, to send relief to the brethren who lived in Judea;",acts
353,"and they did so, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.",acts
354,He killed James the brother of John with the sword;,acts
355,"and when he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. This was during the days of Unleavened Bread.",acts
356,"And when he had seized him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four squads of soldiers to guard him, intending after the Passover to bring him out to the people.",acts
357,So Peter was kept in prison; but earnest prayer for him was made to God by the church.,acts
358,"and behold, an angel of the Lord appeared, and a light shone in the cell; and he struck Peter on the side and woke him, saying, ""Get up quickly."" And the chains fell off his hands.",acts
359,"And the angel said to him, ""Dress yourself and put on your sandals."" And he did so. And he said to him, ""Wrap your mantle around you and follow me.""",acts
360,"And he went out and followed him; he did not know that what was done by the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision.",acts
361,"When they had passed the first and the second guard, they came to the iron gate leading into the city. It opened to them of its own accord, and they went out and passed on through one street; and immediately the angel left him.",acts
362,"And Peter came to himself, and said, ""Now I am sure that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting.""",acts
363,"And when he knocked at the door of the gateway, a maid named Rhoda came to answer.",acts
364,"Recognizing Peter's voice, in her joy she did not open the gate but ran in and told that Peter was standing at the gate.",acts
365,"They said to her, ""You are mad."" But she insisted that it was so. They said, ""It is his angel!""",acts
366,"But Peter continued knocking; and when they opened, they saw him and were amazed.",acts
367,"But motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he described to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, ""Tell this to James and to the brethren."" Then he departed and went to another place.",acts
368,"And when Herod had sought for him and could not find him, he examined the sentries and ordered that they should be put to death. Then he went down from Judea to Caesare'a, and remained there.",acts
369,"On an appointed day Herod put on his royal robes, took his seat upon the throne, and made an oration to them.",acts
370,"And the people shouted, ""The voice of a god, and not of man!""",acts
371,"Immediately an angel of the Lord smote him, because he did not give God the glory; and he was eaten by worms and died.",acts
372,"And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had fulfilled their mission, bringing with them John whose other name was Mark.",acts
373,"While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, ""Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.""",acts
374,Then after fasting and praying they laid their hands on them and sent them off.,acts
375,"When they arrived at Sal'amis, they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. And they had John to assist them.",acts
376,"When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they came upon a certain magician, a Jewish false prophet, named Bar-Jesus.",acts
377,"He was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of intelligence, who summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God.",acts
378,"But El'ymas the magician (for that is the meaning of his name) withstood them, seeking to turn away the proconsul from the faith.",acts
379,"But Saul, who is also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him",acts
380,"and said, ""You son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, full of all deceit and villainy, will you not stop making crooked the straight paths of the Lord?",acts
381,"And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you shall be blind and unable to see the sun for a time."" Immediately mist and darkness fell upon him and he went about seeking people to lead him by the hand.",acts
382,"Then the proconsul believed, when he saw what had occurred, for he was astonished at the teaching of the Lord.",acts
383,but they passed on from Perga and came to Antioch of Pisid'ia. And on the sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down.,acts
384,"After the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, ""Brethren, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say it.""",acts
385,"So Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand said:",acts
386,"The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with uplifted arm he led them out of it.",acts
387,And for about forty years he bore with them in the wilderness.,acts
388,"And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land as an inheritance, for about four hundred and fifty years.",acts
389,And after that he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.,acts
390,"Then they asked for a king; and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.",acts
391,"And when he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king; of whom he testified and said, `I have found in David the son of Jesse a man after my heart, who will do all my will.'",acts
392,"Of this man's posterity God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, as he promised.",acts
393,Before his coming John had preached a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.,acts
394,"And as John was finishing his course, he said, `What do you suppose that I am? I am not he. No, but after me one is coming, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.'",acts
395,"For those who live in Jerusalem and their rulers, because they did not recognize him nor understand the utterances of the prophets which are read every sabbath, fulfilled these by condemning him.",acts
396,"Though they could charge him with nothing deserving death, yet they asked Pilate to have him killed.",acts
397,"And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a tomb.",acts
398,But God raised him from the dead;,acts
399,"and for many days he appeared to those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses to the people.",acts
400,"And we bring you the good news that what God promised to the fathers,",acts
401,"this he has fulfilled to us their children by raising Jesus; as also it is written in the second psalm, `Thou art my Son,",acts
402,"And as for the fact that he raised him from the dead, no more to return to corruption, he spoke in this way, `I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.'",acts
403,"Therefore he says also in another psalm, `Thou wilt not let thy Holy One see corruption.'",acts
404,"For David, after he had served the counsel of God in his own generation, fell asleep, and was laid with his fathers, and saw corruption;",acts
405,but he whom God raised up saw no corruption.,acts
406,"Let it be known to you therefore, brethren, that through this man forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you,",acts
407,and by him every one that believes is freed from everything from which you could not be freed by the law of Moses.,acts
408,"Beware, therefore, lest there come upon you what is said in the prophets:",acts
409,"`Behold, you scoffers, and wonder, and perish;",acts
410,"And when the meeting of the synagogue broke up, many Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who spoke to them and urged them to continue in the grace of God.",acts
411,"But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with jealousy, and contradicted what was spoken by Paul, and reviled him.",acts
412,"And Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, saying, ""It was necessary that the word of God should be spoken first to you. Since you thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles.",acts
413,"For so the Lord has commanded us, saying, `I have set you to be a light for the Gentiles,",acts
414,And the word of the Lord spread throughout all the region.,acts
415,"But the Jews incited the devout women of high standing and the leading men of the city, and stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their district.",acts
416,"But they shook off the dust from their feet against them, and went to Ico'nium.",acts
417,And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.,acts
418,But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brethren.,acts
419,"So they remained for a long time, speaking boldly for the Lord, who bore witness to the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands.",acts
420,"But the people of the city were divided; some sided with the Jews, and some with the apostles.",acts
421,"When an attempt was made by both Gentiles and Jews, with their rulers, to molest them and to stone them,",acts
422,"they learned of it and fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycao'nia, and to the surrounding country;",acts
423,and there they preached the gospel.,acts
424,"He listened to Paul speaking; and Paul, looking intently at him and seeing that he had faith to be made well,",acts
425,"said in a loud voice, ""Stand upright on your feet."" And he sprang up and walked.",acts
426,"And when the crowds saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in Lycao'nian, ""The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!""",acts
427,"Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul, because he was the chief speaker, they called Hermes.",acts
428,"And the priest of Zeus, whose temple was in front of the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates and wanted to offer sacrifice with the people.",acts
429,"But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their garments and rushed out among the multitude, crying,",acts
430,"""Men, why are you doing this? We also are men, of like nature with you, and bring you good news, that you should turn from these vain things to a living God who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them.",acts
431,In past generations he allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways;,acts
432,"yet he did not leave himself without witness, for he did good and gave you from heaven rains and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness.""",acts
433,With these words they scarcely restrained the people from offering sacrifice to them.,acts
434,"But when the disciples gathered about him, he rose up and entered the city; and on the next day he went on with Barnabas to Derbe.",acts
435,"When they had preached the gospel to that city and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra and to Ico'nium and to Antioch,",acts
436,"strengthening the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and saying that through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God.",acts
437,"And when they had appointed elders for them in every church, with prayer and fasting they committed them to the Lord in whom they believed.",acts
438,"And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attali'a;",acts
439,"and from there they sailed to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled.",acts
440,"And when they arrived, they gathered the church together and declared all that God had done with them, and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.",acts
441,And they remained no little time with the disciples.,acts
442,"And when Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and debate with them, Paul and Barnabas and some of the others were appointed to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and the elders about this question.",acts
443,"So, being sent on their way by the church, they passed through both Phoeni'cia and Sama'ria, reporting the conversion of the Gentiles, and they gave great joy to all the brethren.",acts
444,"When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they declared all that God had done with them.",acts
445,"But some believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees rose up, and said, ""It is necessary to circumcise them, and to charge them to keep the law of Moses.""",acts
446,"And after there had been much debate, Peter rose and said to them, ""Brethren, you know that in the early days God made choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe.",acts
447,"And God who knows the heart bore witness to them, giving them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us;",acts
448,"and he made no distinction between us and them, but cleansed their hearts by faith.",acts
449,Now therefore why do you make trial of God by putting a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?,acts
450,"But we believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they will.""",acts
451,"After they finished speaking, James replied, ""Brethren, listen to me.",acts
452,"Simeon has related how God first visited the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.",acts
453,"And with this the words of the prophets agree, as it is written,",acts
454,"`After this I will return,",acts
455,"that the rest of men may seek the Lord,",acts
456,"says the Lord, who has made these things known from of old.'",acts
457,"Therefore my judgment is that we should not trouble those of the Gentiles who turn to God,",acts
458,but should write to them to abstain from the pollutions of idols and from unchastity and from what is strangled and from blood.,acts
459,"For from early generations Moses has had in every city those who preach him, for he is read every sabbath in the synagogues.""",acts
460,"with the following letter: ""The brethren, both the apostles and the elders, to the brethren who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cili'cia, greeting.",acts
461,"Since we have heard that some persons from us have troubled you with words, unsettling your minds, although we gave them no instructions,",acts
462,"it has seemed good to us, having come to one accord, to choose men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,",acts
463,men who have risked their lives for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ.,acts
464,"We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who themselves will tell you the same things by word of mouth.",acts
465,For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things:,acts
466,"that you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled and from unchastity. If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well. Farewell.""",acts
467,"And when they read it, they rejoiced at the exhortation.",acts
468,"And Judas and Silas, who were themselves prophets, exhorted the brethren with many words and strengthened them.",acts
469,"And after they had spent some time, they were sent off in peace by the brethren to those who had sent them.",acts
470,"But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.",acts
471,And Barnabas wanted to take with them John called Mark.,acts
472,"But Paul thought best not to take with them one who had withdrawn from them in Pamphyl'ia, and had not gone with them to the work.",acts
473,"And there arose a sharp contention, so that they separated from each other; Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus,",acts
474,"but Paul chose Silas and departed, being commended by the brethren to the grace of the Lord.",acts
475,"And he went through Syria and Cili'cia, strengthening the churches.",acts
476,He was well spoken of by the brethren at Lystra and Ico'nium.,acts
477,"Paul wanted Timothy to accompany him; and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews that were in those places, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.",acts
478,"As they went on their way through the cities, they delivered to them for observance the decisions which had been reached by the apostles and elders who were at Jerusalem.",acts
479,"So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and they increased in numbers daily.",acts
480,"And when they had come opposite My'sia, they attempted to go into Bithyn'ia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them;",acts
481,"so, passing by My'sia, they went down to Tro'as.",acts
482,"And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: a man of Macedo'nia was standing beseeching him and saying, ""Come over to Macedo'nia and help us.""",acts
483,"And when he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go on into Macedo'nia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.",acts
484,"and from there to Philip'pi, which is the leading city of the district of Macedo'nia, and a Roman colony. We remained in this city some days;",acts
485,"and on the sabbath day we went outside the gate to the riverside, where we supposed there was a place of prayer; and we sat down and spoke to the women who had come together.",acts
486,"One who heard us was a woman named Lydia, from the city of Thyati'ra, a seller of purple goods, who was a worshiper of God. The Lord opened her heart to give heed to what was said by Paul.",acts
487,"And when she was baptized, with her household, she besought us, saying, ""If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come to my house and stay."" And she prevailed upon us.",acts
488,"She followed Paul and us, crying, ""These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to you the way of salvation.""",acts
489,"And this she did for many days. But Paul was annoyed, and turned and said to the spirit, ""I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her."" And it came out that very hour.",acts
490,"and when they had brought them to the magistrates they said, ""These men are Jews and they are disturbing our city.",acts
491,"They advocate customs which it is not lawful for us Romans to accept or practice.""",acts
492,The crowd joined in attacking them; and the magistrates tore the garments off them and gave orders to beat them with rods.,acts
493,"And when they had inflicted many blows upon them, they threw them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them safely.",acts
494,"Having received this charge, he put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.",acts
495,"and suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and every one's fetters were unfastened.",acts
496,"When the jailer woke and saw that the prison doors were open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.",acts
497,"But Paul cried with a loud voice, ""Do not harm yourself, for we are all here.""",acts
498,"And he called for lights and rushed in, and trembling with fear he fell down before Paul and Silas,",acts
499,"and brought them out and said, ""Men, what must I do to be saved?""",acts
500,"And they said, ""Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.""",acts
501,And they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all that were in his house.,acts
502,"And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their wounds, and he was baptized at once, with all his family.",acts
503,"Then he brought them up into his house, and set food before them; and he rejoiced with all his household that he had believed in God.",acts
504,"But when it was day, the magistrates sent the police, saying, ""Let those men go.""",acts
505,"And the jailer reported the words to Paul, saying, ""The magistrates have sent to let you go; now therefore come out and go in peace.""",acts
506,"But Paul said to them, ""They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men who are Roman citizens, and have thrown us into prison; and do they now cast us out secretly? No! let them come themselves and take us out.""",acts
507,"The police reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Roman citizens;",acts
508,so they came and apologized to them. And they took them out and asked them to leave the city.,acts
509,"So they went out of the prison, and visited Lydia; and when they had seen the brethren, they exhorted them and departed.",acts
510,"And Paul went in, as was his custom, and for three weeks he argued with them from the scriptures,",acts
511,"explaining and proving that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead, and saying, ""This Jesus, whom I proclaim to you, is the Christ.""",acts
512,"And some of them were persuaded, and joined Paul and Silas; as did a great many of the devout Greeks and not a few of the leading women.",acts
513,"But the Jews were jealous, and taking some wicked fellows of the rabble, they gathered a crowd, set the city in an uproar, and attacked the house of Jason, seeking to bring them out to the people.",acts
514,"And when they could not find them, they dragged Jason and some of the brethren before the city authorities, crying, ""These men who have turned the world upside down have come here also,",acts
515,"and Jason has received them; and they are all acting against the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus.""",acts
516,And the people and the city authorities were disturbed when they heard this.,acts
517,"And when they had taken security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.",acts
518,"Now these Jews were more noble than those in Thessaloni'ca, for they received the word with all eagerness, examining the scriptures daily to see if these things were so.",acts
519,"Many of them therefore believed, with not a few Greek women of high standing as well as men.",acts
520,"But when the Jews of Thessaloni'ca learned that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul at Beroe'a also, they came there too, stirring up and inciting the crowds.",acts
521,"Then the brethren immediately sent Paul off on his way to the sea, but Silas and Timothy remained there.",acts
522,"Those who conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens; and receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible, they departed.",acts
523,"So he argued in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons, and in the market place every day with those who chanced to be there.",acts
524,"Some also of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers met him. And some said, ""What would this babbler say?"" Others said, ""He seems to be a preacher of foreign divinities"" -- because he preached Jesus and the resurrection.",acts
525,"And they took hold of him and brought him to the Are-op'agus, saying, ""May we know what this new teaching is which you present?",acts
526,"For you bring some strange things to our ears; we wish to know therefore what these things mean.""",acts
527,Now all the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there spent their time in nothing except telling or hearing something new.,acts
528,"For as I passed along, and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription, `To an unknown god.' What therefore you worship as unknown, this I proclaim to you.",acts
529,"The God who made the world and everything in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in shrines made by man,",acts
530,"nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all men life and breath and everything.",acts
531,"And he made from one every nation of men to live on all the face of the earth, having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their habitation,",acts
532,"that they should seek God, in the hope that they might feel after him and find him. Yet he is not far from each one of us,",acts
533,for `In him we live and move and have our being';,acts
534,"The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all men everywhere to repent,",acts
535,"because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed, and of this he has given assurance to all men by raising him from the dead.""",acts
536,So Paul went out from among them.,acts
537,"But some men joined him and believed, among them Dionys'ius the Are-op'agite and a woman named Dam'aris and others with them.",acts
538,"And he found a Jew named Aq'uila, a native of Pontus, lately come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to leave Rome. And he went to see them;",acts
539,"and because he was of the same trade he stayed with them, and they worked, for by trade they were tentmakers.",acts
540,"And he argued in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded Jews and Greeks.",acts
541,"And when they opposed and reviled him, he shook out his garments and said to them, ""Your blood be upon your heads! I am innocent. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.""",acts
542,"And he left there and went to the house of a man named Titius Justus, a worshiper of God; his house was next door to the synagogue.",acts
543,"Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, together with all his household; and many of the Corinthians hearing Paul believed and were baptized.",acts
544,"And the Lord said to Paul one night in a vision, ""Do not be afraid, but speak and do not be silent;",acts
545,"for I am with you, and no man shall attack you to harm you; for I have many people in this city.""",acts
546,"And he stayed a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.",acts
547,"saying, ""This man is persuading men to worship God contrary to the law.""",acts
548,"But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, ""If it were a matter of wrongdoing or vicious crime, I should have reason to bear with you, O Jews;",acts
549,"but since it is a matter of questions about words and names and your own law, see to it yourselves; I refuse to be a judge of these things.""",acts
550,And he drove them from the tribunal.,acts
551,"And they all seized Sos'thenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him in front of the tribunal. But Gallio paid no attention to this.",acts
552,"And they came to Ephesus, and he left them there; but he himself went into the synagogue and argued with the Jews.",acts
553,"When they asked him to stay for a longer period, he declined;",acts
554,"but on taking leave of them he said, ""I will return to you if God wills,"" and he set sail from Ephesus.",acts
555,"After spending some time there he departed and went from place to place through the region of Galatia and Phryg'ia, strengthening all the disciples.",acts
556,"He had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, though he knew only the baptism of John.",acts
557,"He began to speak boldly in the synagogue; but when Priscilla and Aq'uila heard him, they took him and expounded to him the way of God more accurately.",acts
558,"And when he wished to cross to Acha'ia, the brethren encouraged him, and wrote to the disciples to receive him. When he arrived, he greatly helped those who through grace had believed,",acts
559,"for he powerfully confuted the Jews in public, showing by the scriptures that the Christ was Jesus.",acts
560,"And he said to them, ""Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?"" And they said, ""No, we have never even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.""",acts
561,"And he said, ""Into what then were you baptized?"" They said, ""Into John's baptism.""",acts
562,"And Paul said, ""John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, Jesus.""",acts
563,"On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.",acts
564,"And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them; and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.",acts
565,There were about twelve of them in all.,acts
566,"but when some were stubborn and disbelieved, speaking evil of the Way before the congregation, he withdrew from them, taking the disciples with him, and argued daily in the hall of Tyran'nus.",acts
567,"This continued for two years, so that all the residents of Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.",acts
568,"so that handkerchiefs or aprons were carried away from his body to the sick, and diseases left them and the evil spirits came out of them.",acts
569,"Then some of the itinerant Jewish exorcists undertook to pronounce the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, ""I adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul preaches.""",acts
570,Seven sons of a Jewish high priest named Sceva were doing this.,acts
571,"But the evil spirit answered them, ""Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?""",acts
572,"And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, mastered all of them, and overpowered them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.",acts
573,"And this became known to all residents of Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks; and fear fell upon them all; and the name of the Lord Jesus was extolled.",acts
574,"Many also of those who were now believers came, confessing and divulging their practices.",acts
575,And a number of those who practiced magic arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all; and they counted the value of them and found it came to fifty thousand pieces of silver.,acts
576,So the word of the Lord grew and prevailed mightily.,acts
577,"And having sent into Macedo'nia two of his helpers, Timothy and Eras'tus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while.",acts
578,"For a man named Deme'trius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Ar'temis, brought no little business to the craftsmen.",acts
579,"These he gathered together, with the workmen of like occupation, and said, ""Men, you know that from this business we have our wealth.",acts
580,"And you see and hear that not only at Ephesus but almost throughout all Asia this Paul has persuaded and turned away a considerable company of people, saying that gods made with hands are not gods.",acts
581,"And there is danger not only that this trade of ours may come into disrepute but also that the temple of the great goddess Ar'temis may count for nothing, and that she may even be deposed from her magnificence, she whom all Asia and the world worship.""",acts
582,"So the city was filled with the confusion; and they rushed together into the theater, dragging with them Ga'ius and Aristar'chus, Macedo'nians who were Paul's companions in travel.",acts
583,"Paul wished to go in among the crowd, but the disciples would not let him;",acts
584,"some of the A'si-archs also, who were friends of his, sent to him and begged him not to venture into the theater.",acts
585,"Now some cried one thing, some another; for the assembly was in confusion, and most of them did not know why they had come together.",acts
586,"Some of the crowd prompted Alexander, whom the Jews had put forward. And Alexander motioned with his hand, wishing to make a defense to the people.",acts
587,"But when they recognized that he was a Jew, for about two hours they all with one voice cried out, ""Great is Ar'temis of the Ephesians!""",acts
588,"And when the town clerk had quieted the crowd, he said, ""Men of Ephesus, what man is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple keeper of the great Ar'temis, and of the sacred stone that fell from the sky?",acts
589,"Seeing then that these things cannot be contradicted, you ought to be quiet and do nothing rash.",acts
590,For you have brought these men here who are neither sacrilegious nor blasphemers of our goddess.,acts
591,"If therefore Deme'trius and the craftsmen with him have a complaint against any one, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls; let them bring charges against one another.",acts
592,"But if you seek anything further, it shall be settled in the regular assembly.",acts
593,"For we are in danger of being charged with rioting today, there being no cause that we can give to justify this commotion.""",acts
594,"And when he had said this, he dismissed the assembly.",acts
595,"When he had gone through these parts and had given them much encouragement, he came to Greece.",acts
596,"There he spent three months, and when a plot was made against him by the Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he determined to return through Macedo'nia.",acts
597,"Sop'ater of Beroe'a, the son of Pyrrhus, accompanied him; and of the Thessalo'nians, Aristar'chus and Secun'dus; and Ga'ius of Derbe, and Timothy; and the Asians, Tych'icus and Troph'imus.",acts
598,"These went on and were waiting for us at Tro'as,",acts
599,"but we sailed away from Philip'pi after the days of Unleavened Bread, and in five days we came to them at Tro'as, where we stayed for seven days.",acts
600,There were many lights in the upper chamber where we were gathered.,acts
601,"And a young man named Eu'tychus was sitting in the window. He sank into a deep sleep as Paul talked still longer; and being overcome by sleep, he fell down from the third story and was taken up dead.",acts
602,"But Paul went down and bent over him, and embracing him said, ""Do not be alarmed, for his life is in him.""",acts
603,"And when Paul had gone up and had broken bread and eaten, he conversed with them a long while, until daybreak, and so departed.",acts
604,"And they took the lad away alive, and were not a little comforted.",acts
605,"And when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and came to Mityle'ne.",acts
606,And sailing from there we came the following day opposite Chi'os; the next day we touched at Samos; and the day after that we came to Mile'tus.,acts
607,"For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so that he might not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hastening to be at Jerusalem, if possible, on the day of Pentecost.",acts
608,"And when they came to him, he said to them:",acts
609,serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and with trials which befell me through the plots of the Jews;,acts
610,"how I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and teaching you in public and from house to house,",acts
611,testifying both to Jews and to Greeks of repentance to God and of faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.,acts
612,"And now, behold, I am going to Jerusalem, bound in the Spirit, not knowing what shall befall me there;",acts
613,except that the Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city that imprisonment and afflictions await me.,acts
614,"But I do not account my life of any value nor as precious to myself, if only I may accomplish my course and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God.",acts
615,"And now, behold, I know that all you among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom will see my face no more.",acts
616,"Therefore I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all of you,",acts
617,for I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God.,acts
618,"Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to care for the church of God which he obtained with the blood of his own Son.",acts
619,"I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock;",acts
620,"and from among your own selves will arise men speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them.",acts
621,"Therefore be alert, remembering that for three years I did not cease night or day to admonish every one with tears.",acts
622,"And now I commend you to God and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified.",acts
623,I coveted no one's silver or gold or apparel.,acts
624,"You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my necessities, and to those who were with me.",acts
625,"In all things I have shown you that by so toiling one must help the weak, remembering the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, `It is more blessed to give than to receive.'""",acts
626,"And they all wept and embraced Paul and kissed him,",acts
627,"sorrowing most of all because of the word he had spoken, that they should see his face no more. And they brought him to the ship.",acts
628,"And having found a ship crossing to Phoeni'cia, we went aboard, and set sail.",acts
629,"When we had come in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on the left we sailed to Syria, and landed at Tyre; for there the ship was to unload its cargo.",acts
630,"And having sought out the disciples, we stayed there for seven days. Through the Spirit they told Paul not to go on to Jerusalem.",acts
631,"And when our days there were ended, we departed and went on our journey; and they all, with wives and children, brought us on our way till we were outside the city; and kneeling down on the beach we prayed and bade one another farewell.",acts
632,"Then we went on board the ship, and they returned home.",acts
633,"On the morrow we departed and came to Caesare'a; and we entered the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him.",acts
634,"And he had four unmarried daughters, who prophesied.",acts
635,"While we were staying for some days, a prophet named Ag'abus came down from Judea.",acts
636,"And coming to us he took Paul's girdle and bound his own feet and hands, and said, ""Thus says the Holy Spirit, `So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man who owns this girdle and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.'""",acts
637,"When we heard this, we and the people there begged him not to go up to Jerusalem.",acts
638,"Then Paul answered, ""What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be imprisoned but even to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.""",acts
639,"And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased and said, ""The will of the Lord be done.""",acts
640,"And some of the disciples from Caesare'a went with us, bringing us to the house of Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we should lodge.",acts
641,On the following day Paul went in with us to James; and all the elders were present.,acts
642,"After greeting them, he related one by one the things that God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.",acts
643,"And when they heard it, they glorified God. And they said to him, ""You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed; they are all zealous for the law,",acts
644,"and they have been told about you that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or observe the customs.",acts
645,What then is to be done? They will certainly hear that you have come.,acts
646,Do therefore what we tell you. We have four men who are under a vow;,acts
647,"take these men and purify yourself along with them and pay their expenses, so that they may shave their heads. Thus all will know that there is nothing in what they have been told about you but that you yourself live in observance of the law.",acts
648,"But as for the Gentiles who have believed, we have sent a letter with our judgment that they should abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled and from unchastity.""",acts
649,"Then Paul took the men, and the next day he purified himself with them and went into the temple, to give notice when the days of purification would be fulfilled and the offering presented for every one of them.",acts
650,"crying out, ""Men of Israel, help! This is the man who is teaching men everywhere against the people and the law and this place; moreover he also brought Greeks into the temple, and he has defiled this holy place.""",acts
651,"For they had previously seen Troph'imus the Ephesian with him in the city, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple.",acts
652,"Then all the city was aroused, and the people ran together; they seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple, and at once the gates were shut.",acts
653,"And as they were trying to kill him, word came to the tribune of the cohort that all Jerusalem was in confusion.",acts
654,"He at once took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them; and when they saw the tribune and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.",acts
655,"Then the tribune came up and arrested him, and ordered him to be bound with two chains. He inquired who he was and what he had done.",acts
656,"Some in the crowd shouted one thing, some another; and as he could not learn the facts because of the uproar, he ordered him to be brought into the barracks.",acts
657,"And when he came to the steps, he was actually carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd;",acts
658,"for the mob of the people followed, crying, ""Away with him!""",acts
659,"Are you not the Egyptian, then, who recently stirred up a revolt and led the four thousand men of the Assassins out into the wilderness?""",acts
660,"Paul replied, ""I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cili'cia, a citizen of no mean city; I beg you, let me speak to the people.""",acts
661,"And when he had given him leave, Paul, standing on the steps, motioned with his hand to the people; and when there was a great hush, he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, saying:",acts
662,"I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering to prison both men and women,",acts
663,"as the high priest and the whole council of elders bear me witness. From them I received letters to the brethren, and I journeyed to Damascus to take those also who were there and bring them in bonds to Jerusalem to be punished.",acts
664,"And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, `Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?'",acts
665,"And I answered, `Who are you, Lord?' And he said to me, `I am Jesus of Nazareth whom you are persecuting.'",acts
666,Now those who were with me saw the light but did not hear the voice of the one who was speaking to me.,acts
667,"And I said, `What shall I do, Lord?' And the Lord said to me, `Rise, and go into Damascus, and there you will be told all that is appointed for you to do.'",acts
668,"And when I could not see because of the brightness of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me, and came into Damascus.",acts
669,"came to me, and standing by me said to me, `Brother Saul, receive your sight.' And in that very hour I received my sight and saw him.",acts
670,"And he said, `The God of our fathers appointed you to know his will, to see the Just One and to hear a voice from his mouth;",acts
671,for you will be a witness for him to all men of what you have seen and heard.,acts
672,"And now why do you wait? Rise and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on his name.'",acts
673,"and saw him saying to me, `Make haste and get quickly out of Jerusalem, because they will not accept your testimony about me.'",acts
674,"And I said, `Lord, they themselves know that in every synagogue I imprisoned and beat those who believed in thee.",acts
675,"And when the blood of Stephen thy witness was shed, I also was standing by and approving, and keeping the garments of those who killed him.'",acts
676,"And he said to me, `Depart; for I will send you far away to the Gentiles.'""",acts
677,"And as they cried out and waved their garments and threw dust into the air,",acts
678,"the tribune commanded him to be brought into the barracks, and ordered him to be examined by scourging, to find out why they shouted thus against him.",acts
679,"But when they had tied him up with the thongs, Paul said to the centurion who was standing by, ""Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman citizen, and uncondemned?""",acts
680,"When the centurion heard that, he went to the tribune and said to him, ""What are you about to do? For this man is a Roman citizen.""",acts
681,"So the tribune came and said to him, ""Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?"" And he said, ""Yes.""",acts
682,"The tribune answered, ""I bought this citizenship for a large sum."" Paul said, ""But I was born a citizen.""",acts
683,"So those who were about to examine him withdrew from him instantly; and the tribune also was afraid, for he realized that Paul was a Roman citizen and that he had bound him.",acts
684,And the high priest Anani'as commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth.,acts
685,"Then Paul said to him, ""God shall strike you, you whitewashed wall! Are you sitting to judge me according to the law, and yet contrary to the law you order me to be struck?""",acts
686,"Those who stood by said, ""Would you revile God's high priest?""",acts
687,"And Paul said, ""I did not know, brethren, that he was the high priest; for it is written, `You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.'""",acts
688,"And when he had said this, a dissension arose between the Pharisees and the Sad'ducees; and the assembly was divided.",acts
689,"For the Sad'ducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit; but the Pharisees acknowledge them all.",acts
690,"Then a great clamor arose; and some of the scribes of the Pharisees' party stood up and contended, ""We find nothing wrong in this man. What if a spirit or an angel spoke to him?""",acts
691,"And when the dissension became violent, the tribune, afraid that Paul would be torn in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them and bring him into the barracks.",acts
692,There were more than forty who made this conspiracy.,acts
693,"And they went to the chief priests and elders, and said, ""We have strictly bound ourselves by an oath to taste no food till we have killed Paul.",acts
694,"You therefore, along with the council, give notice now to the tribune to bring him down to you, as though you were going to determine his case more exactly. And we are ready to kill him before he comes near.""",acts
695,"And Paul called one of the centurions and said, ""Take this young man to the tribune; for he has something to tell him.""",acts
696,"So he took him and brought him to the tribune and said, ""Paul the prisoner called me and asked me to bring this young man to you, as he has something to say to you.""",acts
697,"The tribune took him by the hand, and going aside asked him privately, ""What is it that you have to tell me?""",acts
698,"And he said, ""The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the council tomorrow, as though they were going to inquire somewhat more closely about him.",acts
699,"But do not yield to them; for more than forty of their men lie in ambush for him, having bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink till they have killed him; and now they are ready, waiting for the promise from you.""",acts
700,"So the tribune dismissed the young man, charging him, ""Tell no one that you have informed me of this.""",acts
701,"Also provide mounts for Paul to ride, and bring him safely to Felix the governor.""",acts
702,And he wrote a letter to this effect:,acts
703,"This man was seized by the Jews, and was about to be killed by them, when I came upon them with the soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman citizen.",acts
704,"And desiring to know the charge on which they accused him, I brought him down to their council.",acts
705,"I found that he was accused about questions of their law, but charged with nothing deserving death or imprisonment.",acts
706,"And when it was disclosed to me that there would be a plot against the man, I sent him to you at once, ordering his accusers also to state before you what they have against him.""",acts
707,"And on the morrow they returned to the barracks, leaving the horsemen to go on with him.",acts
708,"When they came to Caesare'a and delivered the letter to the governor, they presented Paul also before him.",acts
709,"On reading the letter, he asked to what province he belonged. When he learned that he was from Cili'cia",acts
710,"he said, ""I will hear you when your accusers arrive."" And he commanded him to be guarded in Herod's praetorium.",acts
711,"and when he was called, Tertul'lus began to accuse him, saying:",acts
712,in every way and everywhere we accept this with all gratitude.,acts
713,"But, to detain you no further, I beg you in your kindness to hear us briefly.",acts
714,"For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, an agitator among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.",acts
715,"He even tried to profane the temple, but we seized him.",acts
716,"By examining him yourself you will be able to learn from him about everything of which we accuse him.""",acts
717,"And when the governor had motioned to him to speak, Paul replied:",acts
718,"As you may ascertain, it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem;",acts
719,"and they did not find me disputing with any one or stirring up a crowd, either in the temple or in the synagogues, or in the city.",acts
720,Neither can they prove to you what they now bring up against me.,acts
721,"But this I admit to you, that according to the Way, which they call a sect, I worship the God of our fathers, believing everything laid down by the law or written in the prophets,",acts
722,"having a hope in God which these themselves accept, that there will be a resurrection of both the just and the unjust.",acts
723,So I always take pains to have a clear conscience toward God and toward men.,acts
724,Now after some years I came to bring to my nation alms and offerings.,acts
725,"As I was doing this, they found me purified in the temple, without any crowd or tumult. But some Jews from Asia --",acts
726,"they ought to be here before you and to make an accusation, if they have anything against me.",acts
727,"Or else let these men themselves say what wrongdoing they found when I stood before the council,",acts
728,"except this one thing which I cried out while standing among them, `With respect to the resurrection of the dead I am on trial before you this day.'""",acts
729,"Then he gave orders to the centurion that he should be kept in custody but should have some liberty, and that none of his friends should be prevented from attending to his needs.",acts
730,"And as he argued about justice and self-control and future judgment, Felix was alarmed and said, ""Go away for the present; when I have an opportunity I will summon you.""",acts
731,At the same time he hoped that money would be given him by Paul. So he sent for him often and conversed with him.,acts
732,"But when two years had elapsed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and desiring to do the Jews a favor, Felix left Paul in prison.",acts
733,"And the chief priests and the principal men of the Jews informed him against Paul; and they urged him,",acts
734,"asking as a favor to have the man sent to Jerusalem, planning an ambush to kill him on the way.",acts
735,"Festus replied that Paul was being kept at Caesare'a, and that he himself intended to go there shortly.",acts
736,"""So,"" said he, ""let the men of authority among you go down with me, and if there is anything wrong about the man, let them accuse him.""",acts
737,"And when he had come, the Jews who had gone down from Jerusalem stood about him, bringing against him many serious charges which they could not prove.",acts
738,"Paul said in his defense, ""Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar have I offended at all.""",acts
739,"But Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favor, said to Paul, ""Do you wish to go up to Jerusalem, and there be tried on these charges before me?""",acts
740,"But Paul said, ""I am standing before Caesar's tribunal, where I ought to be tried; to the Jews I have done no wrong, as you know very well.",acts
741,"If then I am a wrongdoer, and have committed anything for which I deserve to die, I do not seek to escape death; but if there is nothing in their charges against me, no one can give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar.""",acts
742,"Then Festus, when he had conferred with his council, answered, ""You have appealed to Caesar; to Caesar you shall go.""",acts
743,"And as they stayed there many days, Festus laid Paul's case before the king, saying, ""There is a man left prisoner by Felix;",acts
744,"and when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews gave information about him, asking for sentence against him.",acts
745,"I answered them that it was not the custom of the Romans to give up any one before the accused met the accusers face to face, and had opportunity to make his defense concerning the charge laid against him.",acts
746,"When therefore they came together here, I made no delay, but on the next day took my seat on the tribunal and ordered the man to be brought in.",acts
747,"When the accusers stood up, they brought no charge in his case of such evils as I supposed;",acts
748,"but they had certain points of dispute with him about their own superstition and about one Jesus, who was dead, but whom Paul asserted to be alive.",acts
749,"Being at a loss how to investigate these questions, I asked whether he wished to go to Jerusalem and be tried there regarding them.",acts
750,"But when Paul had appealed to be kept in custody for the decision of the emperor, I commanded him to be held until I could send him to Caesar.""",acts
751,"And Agrippa said to Festus, ""I should like to hear the man myself."" ""Tomorrow,"" said he, ""you shall hear him.""",acts
752,"And Festus said, ""King Agrippa and all who are present with us, you see this man about whom the whole Jewish people petitioned me, both at Jerusalem and here, shouting that he ought not to live any longer.",acts
753,"But I found that he had done nothing deserving death; and as he himself appealed to the emperor, I decided to send him.",acts
754,"But I have nothing definite to write to my lord about him. Therefore I have brought him before you, and, especially before you, King Agrippa, that, after we have examined him, I may have something to write.",acts
755,"For it seems to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not to indicate the charges against him.""",acts
756,because you are especially familiar with all customs and controversies of the Jews; therefore I beg you to listen to me patiently.,acts
757,"They have known for a long time, if they are willing to testify, that according to the strictest party of our religion I have lived as a Pharisee.",acts
758,"And now I stand here on trial for hope in the promise made by God to our fathers,",acts
759,"to which our twelve tribes hope to attain, as they earnestly worship night and day. And for this hope I am accused by Jews, O king!",acts
760,Why is it thought incredible by any of you that God raises the dead?,acts
761,"And I did so in Jerusalem; I not only shut up many of the saints in prison, by authority from the chief priests, but when they were put to death I cast my vote against them.",acts
762,"And I punished them often in all the synagogues and tried to make them blaspheme; and in raging fury against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities.",acts
763,"At midday, O king, I saw on the way a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining round me and those who journeyed with me.",acts
764,"And when we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language, `Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It hurts you to kick against the goads.'",acts
765,"And I said, `Who are you, Lord?' And the Lord said, `I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.",acts
766,"But rise and stand upon your feet; for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you to serve and bear witness to the things in which you have seen me and to those in which I will appear to you,",acts
767,delivering you from the people and from the Gentiles -- to whom I send you,acts
768,"to open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.'",acts
769,"but declared first to those at Damascus, then at Jerusalem and throughout all the country of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God and perform deeds worthy of their repentance.",acts
770,For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me.,acts
771,"To this day I have had the help that comes from God, and so I stand here testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would come to pass:",acts
772,"that the Christ must suffer, and that, by being the first to rise from the dead, he would proclaim light both to the people and to the Gentiles.""",acts
773,"But Paul said, ""I am not mad, most excellent Festus, but I am speaking the sober truth.",acts
774,"For the king knows about these things, and to him I speak freely; for I am persuaded that none of these things has escaped his notice, for this was not done in a corner.",acts
775,"King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.""",acts
776,"And Agrippa said to Paul, ""In a short time you think to make me a Christian!""",acts
777,"And Paul said, ""Whether short or long, I would to God that not only you but also all who hear me this day might become such as I am -- except for these chains.""",acts
778,"and when they had withdrawn, they said to one another, ""This man is doing nothing to deserve death or imprisonment.""",acts
779,"And Agrippa said to Festus, ""This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.""",acts
780,"And embarking in a ship of Adramyt'tium, which was about to sail to the ports along the coast of Asia, we put to sea, accompanied by Aristar'chus, a Macedo'nian from Thessaloni'ca.",acts
781,"The next day we put in at Sidon; and Julius treated Paul kindly, and gave him leave to go to his friends and be cared for.",acts
782,"And putting to sea from there we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were against us.",acts
783,"And when we had sailed across the sea which is off Cili'cia and Pamphyl'ia, we came to Myra in Ly'cia.",acts
784,"There the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy, and put us on board.",acts
785,"We sailed slowly for a number of days, and arrived with difficulty off Cni'dus, and as the wind did not allow us to go on, we sailed under the lee of Crete off Salmo'ne.",acts
786,"Coasting along it with difficulty, we came to a place called Fair Havens, near which was the city of Lase'a.",acts
787,"saying, ""Sirs, I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.""",acts
788,But the centurion paid more attention to the captain and to the owner of the ship than to what Paul said.,acts
789,"And because the harbor was not suitable to winter in, the majority advised to put to sea from there, on the chance that somehow they could reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete, looking northeast and southeast, and winter there.",acts
790,"But soon a tempestuous wind, called the northeaster, struck down from the land;",acts
791,"and when the ship was caught and could not face the wind, we gave way to it and were driven.",acts
792,"And running under the lee of a small island called Cauda, we managed with difficulty to secure the boat;",acts
793,"after hoisting it up, they took measures to undergird the ship; then, fearing that they should run on the Syr'tis, they lowered the gear, and so were driven.",acts
794,"As we were violently storm-tossed, they began next day to throw the cargo overboard;",acts
795,and the third day they cast out with their own hands the tackle of the ship.,acts
796,"And when neither sun nor stars appeared for many a day, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope of our being saved was at last abandoned.",acts
797,"I now bid you take heart; for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.",acts
798,"For this very night there stood by me an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I worship,",acts
799,"and he said, `Do not be afraid, Paul; you must stand before Caesar; and lo, God has granted you all those who sail with you.'",acts
800,"So take heart, men, for I have faith in God that it will be exactly as I have been told.",acts
801,"But we shall have to run on some island.""",acts
802,So they sounded and found twenty fathoms; a little farther on they sounded again and found fifteen fathoms.,acts
803,"And fearing that we might run on the rocks, they let out four anchors from the stern, and prayed for day to come.",acts
804,"And as the sailors were seeking to escape from the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea, under pretense of laying out anchors from the bow,",acts
805,"Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, ""Unless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved.""",acts
806,"Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat, and let it go.",acts
807,"Therefore I urge you to take some food; it will give you strength, since not a hair is to perish from the head of any of you.""",acts
808,"And when he had said this, he took bread, and giving thanks to God in the presence of all he broke it and began to eat.",acts
809,Then they all were encouraged and ate some food themselves.,acts
810,(We were in all two hundred and seventy-six persons in the ship.),acts
811,"And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea.",acts
812,"So they cast off the anchors and left them in the sea, at the same time loosening the ropes that tied the rudders; then hoisting the foresail to the wind they made for the beach.",acts
813,"But striking a shoal they ran the vessel aground; the bow stuck and remained immovable, and the stern was broken up by the surf.",acts
814,"The soldiers' plan was to kill the prisoners, lest any should swim away and escape;",acts
815,"but the centurion, wishing to save Paul, kept them from carrying out their purpose. He ordered those who could swim to throw themselves overboard first and make for the land,",acts
816,and the rest on planks or on pieces of the ship. And so it was that all escaped to land.,acts
817,"And the natives showed us unusual kindness, for they kindled a fire and welcomed us all, because it had begun to rain and was cold.",acts
818,"Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and put them on the fire, when a viper came out because of the heat and fastened on his hand.",acts
819,"When the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, ""No doubt this man is a murderer. Though he has escaped from the sea, justice has not allowed him to live.""",acts
820,"He, however, shook off the creature into the fire and suffered no harm.",acts
821,"They waited, expecting him to swell up or suddenly fall down dead; but when they had waited a long time and saw no misfortune come to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.",acts
822,"It happened that the father of Publius lay sick with fever and dysentery; and Paul visited him and prayed, and putting his hands on him healed him.",acts
823,"And when this had taken place, the rest of the people on the island who had diseases also came and were cured.",acts
824,"They presented many gifts to us; and when we sailed, they put on board whatever we needed.",acts
825,"Putting in at Syracuse, we stayed there for three days.",acts
826,"And from there we made a circuit and arrived at Rhe'gium; and after one day a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Pute'oli.",acts
827,"There we found brethren, and were invited to stay with them for seven days. And so we came to Rome.",acts
828,"And the brethren there, when they heard of us, came as far as the Forum of Ap'pius and Three Taverns to meet us. On seeing them Paul thanked God and took courage.",acts
829,"And when we came into Rome, Paul was allowed to stay by himself, with the soldier that guarded him.",acts
830,"When they had examined me, they wished to set me at liberty, because there was no reason for the death penalty in my case.",acts
831,"But when the Jews objected, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar -- though I had no charge to bring against my nation.",acts
832,"For this reason therefore I have asked to see you and speak with you, since it is because of the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain.""",acts
833,"And they said to him, ""We have received no letters from Judea about you, and none of the brethren coming here has reported or spoken any evil about you.",acts
834,"But we desire to hear from you what your views are; for with regard to this sect we know that everywhere it is spoken against.""",acts
835,"And some were convinced by what he said, while others disbelieved.",acts
836,"So, as they disagreed among themselves, they departed, after Paul had made one statement: ""The Holy Spirit was right in saying to your fathers through Isaiah the prophet:",acts

2,"Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.",1_corinthians
3,"I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;",1_corinthians
4,"That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;",1_corinthians
5,Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:,1_corinthians
6,So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:,1_corinthians
7,"Who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.",1_corinthians
8,"God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.",1_corinthians
9,"Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.",1_corinthians
10,"For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.",1_corinthians
11,"Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.",1_corinthians
12,Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?,1_corinthians
13,"I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;",1_corinthians
14,Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.,1_corinthians
15,"And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.",1_corinthians
16,"For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.",1_corinthians
17,For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.,1_corinthians
18,"For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.",1_corinthians
19,Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?,1_corinthians
20,"For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.",1_corinthians
21,"For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:",1_corinthians
22,"But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;",1_corinthians
23,"But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.",1_corinthians
24,Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.,1_corinthians
25,"For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:",1_corinthians
26,But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;,1_corinthians
27,"And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:",1_corinthians
28,That no flesh should glory in his presence.,1_corinthians
29,"But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:",1_corinthians
30,"That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.",1_corinthians
31,"And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.",1_corinthians
32,"For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.",1_corinthians
33,"And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.",1_corinthians
34,"And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:",1_corinthians
35,"That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.",1_corinthians
36,"Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:",1_corinthians
37,"But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:",1_corinthians
38,"Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.",1_corinthians
39,"But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.",1_corinthians
40,"But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.",1_corinthians
41,"For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.",1_corinthians
42,"Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.",1_corinthians
43,"Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.",1_corinthians
44,"But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.",1_corinthians
45,"But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.",1_corinthians
46,"For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.",1_corinthians
47,"And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.",1_corinthians
48,"I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.",1_corinthians
49,"For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?",1_corinthians
50,"For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal?",1_corinthians
51,"Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?",1_corinthians
52,"I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.",1_corinthians
53,"So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.",1_corinthians
54,Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.,1_corinthians
55,"For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.",1_corinthians
56,"According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.",1_corinthians
57,"For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.",1_corinthians
58,"Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;",1_corinthians
59,"Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.",1_corinthians
60,"If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.",1_corinthians
61,"If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.",1_corinthians
62,"Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?",1_corinthians
63,"If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.",1_corinthians
64,"Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.",1_corinthians
65,"For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.",1_corinthians
66,"And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.",1_corinthians
67,Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;,1_corinthians
68,"Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;",1_corinthians
69,And ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.,1_corinthians
70,"Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.",1_corinthians
71,"Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.",1_corinthians
72,"But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.",1_corinthians
73,For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.,1_corinthians
74,"Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.",1_corinthians
75,"And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.",1_corinthians
76,"For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?",1_corinthians
77,"Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.",1_corinthians
78,"For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.",1_corinthians
79,"We are fools for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised.",1_corinthians
80,"Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;",1_corinthians
81,"And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:",1_corinthians
82,"Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day.",1_corinthians
83,"I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you.",1_corinthians
84,"For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.",1_corinthians
85,"Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.",1_corinthians
86,"For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.",1_corinthians
87,"Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.",1_corinthians
88,"But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.",1_corinthians
89,"For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.",1_corinthians
90,"What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?",1_corinthians
91,"It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.",1_corinthians
92,"And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.",1_corinthians
93,"For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed,",1_corinthians
94,"In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,",1_corinthians
95,"To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.",1_corinthians
96,Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?,1_corinthians
97,"Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:",1_corinthians
98,"Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.",1_corinthians
99,I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:,1_corinthians
100,"Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.",1_corinthians
101,"But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.",1_corinthians
102,For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?,1_corinthians
103,But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.,1_corinthians
104,"Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?",1_corinthians
105,"Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?",1_corinthians
106,Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?,1_corinthians
107,"If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.",1_corinthians
108,"I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?",1_corinthians
109,"But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.",1_corinthians
110,"Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?",1_corinthians
111,"Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren.",1_corinthians
112,"Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,",1_corinthians
113,"Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.",1_corinthians
114,"And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.",1_corinthians
115,"All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.",1_corinthians
116,"Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.",1_corinthians
117,"And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.",1_corinthians
118,"Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.",1_corinthians
119,"What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.",1_corinthians
120,But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.,1_corinthians
121,Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that commiteth fornication sinneth against his own body.,1_corinthians
122,"What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?",1_corinthians
123,"For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.",1_corinthians
124,Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.,1_corinthians
125,"Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.",1_corinthians
126,Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.,1_corinthians
127,"The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife.",1_corinthians
128,"Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.",1_corinthians
129,"But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.",1_corinthians
130,"For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.",1_corinthians
131,"I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.",1_corinthians
132,"But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.",1_corinthians
133,"And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:",1_corinthians
134,"But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.",1_corinthians
135,"But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.",1_corinthians
136,"And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.",1_corinthians
137,"For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.",1_corinthians
138,"But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace.",1_corinthians
139,"For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?",1_corinthians
140,"But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.",1_corinthians
141,Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.,1_corinthians
142,"Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.",1_corinthians
143,Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.,1_corinthians
144,"Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.",1_corinthians
145,"For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ's servant.",1_corinthians
146,Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.,1_corinthians
147,"Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.",1_corinthians
148,"Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.",1_corinthians
149,"I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be.",1_corinthians
150,Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.,1_corinthians
151,"But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.",1_corinthians
152,"But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;",1_corinthians
153,"And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;",1_corinthians
154,"And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away.",1_corinthians
155,"But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:",1_corinthians
156,"But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife.",1_corinthians
157,"There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.",1_corinthians
158,"And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.",1_corinthians
159,"But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.",1_corinthians
160,"Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.",1_corinthians
161,So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better.,1_corinthians
162,"The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.",1_corinthians
163,"But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.",1_corinthians
164,"Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.",1_corinthians
165,"And if any man think that he knoweth anything, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.",1_corinthians
166,"But if any man love God, the same is known of him.",1_corinthians
167,"As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one.",1_corinthians
168,"For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)",1_corinthians
169,"But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.",1_corinthians
170,Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.,1_corinthians
171,"But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.",1_corinthians
172,But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak.,1_corinthians
173,"For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;",1_corinthians
174,"And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?",1_corinthians
175,"But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.",1_corinthians
176,"Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.",1_corinthians
177,Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?,1_corinthians
178,"If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.",1_corinthians
179,"Mine answer to them that do examine me is this,",1_corinthians
180,Have we not power to eat and to drink?,1_corinthians
181,"Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?",1_corinthians
182,"Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?",1_corinthians
183,"Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?",1_corinthians
184,Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?,1_corinthians
185,"For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?",1_corinthians
186,"Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.",1_corinthians
187,"If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?",1_corinthians
188,"If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.",1_corinthians
189,Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the alter are partakers with the alter?,1_corinthians
190,Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.,1_corinthians
191,"But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.",1_corinthians
192,"For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!",1_corinthians
193,"For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me.",1_corinthians
194,"What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.",1_corinthians
195,"For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more.",1_corinthians
196,"And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;",1_corinthians
197,"To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.",1_corinthians
198,"To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.",1_corinthians
199,"And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.",1_corinthians
200,"Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.",1_corinthians
201,And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.,1_corinthians
202,"I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air:",1_corinthians
203,"But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.",1_corinthians
204,"Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;",1_corinthians
205,And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;,1_corinthians
206,And did all eat the same spiritual meat;,1_corinthians
207,And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.,1_corinthians
208,But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.,1_corinthians
209,"Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.",1_corinthians
210,"Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.",1_corinthians
211,"Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.",1_corinthians
212,"Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents.",1_corinthians
213,"Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer.",1_corinthians
214,"Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.",1_corinthians
215,Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.,1_corinthians
216,"There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.",1_corinthians
217,"Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.",1_corinthians
218,I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.,1_corinthians
219,"The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?",1_corinthians
220,"For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.",1_corinthians
221,Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the alter?,1_corinthians
222,"What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?",1_corinthians
223,"But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils.",1_corinthians
224,"Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils.",1_corinthians
225,Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?,1_corinthians
226,"All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.",1_corinthians
227,"Let no man seek his own, but every man another's wealth.",1_corinthians
228,"Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake:",1_corinthians
229,"For the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof.",1_corinthians
230,"If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake.",1_corinthians
231,"But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof:",1_corinthians
232,"Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another man's conscience?",1_corinthians
233,"For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?",1_corinthians
234,"Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.",1_corinthians
235,"Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God:",1_corinthians
236,"Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.",1_corinthians
237,"Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.",1_corinthians
238,"Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.",1_corinthians
239,"But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.",1_corinthians
240,"Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head.",1_corinthians
241,But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.,1_corinthians
242,"For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.",1_corinthians
243,"For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.",1_corinthians
244,For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.,1_corinthians
245,Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.,1_corinthians
246,For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.,1_corinthians
247,"Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.",1_corinthians
248,"For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of god.",1_corinthians
249,Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?,1_corinthians
250,"Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?",1_corinthians
251,"But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.",1_corinthians
252,"But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.",1_corinthians
253,"Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.",1_corinthians
254,"For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.",1_corinthians
255,"For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.",1_corinthians
256,"When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper.",1_corinthians
257,"For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.",1_corinthians
258,"What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.",1_corinthians
259,"For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:",1_corinthians
260,"And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.",1_corinthians
261,"After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.",1_corinthians
262,"For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.",1_corinthians
263,"Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.",1_corinthians
264,"But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.",1_corinthians
265,"For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.",1_corinthians
266,"For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.",1_corinthians
267,"For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.",1_corinthians
268,"But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.",1_corinthians
269,"Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.",1_corinthians
270,"And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.",1_corinthians
271,"Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.",1_corinthians
272,"Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.",1_corinthians
273,"Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.",1_corinthians
274,"Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.",1_corinthians
275,"And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.",1_corinthians
276,"And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.",1_corinthians
277,But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.,1_corinthians
278,For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;,1_corinthians
279,To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;,1_corinthians
280,To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:,1_corinthians
281,"But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.",1_corinthians
282,"For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.",1_corinthians
283,"For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.",1_corinthians
284,"For the body is not one member, but many.",1_corinthians
285,"If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?",1_corinthians
286,"And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?",1_corinthians
287,"If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?",1_corinthians
288,"But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.",1_corinthians
289,"And if they were all one member, where were the body?",1_corinthians
290,"But now are they many members, yet but one body.",1_corinthians
291,"And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.",1_corinthians
292,"Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:",1_corinthians
293,"And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.",1_corinthians
294,"For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked:",1_corinthians
295,That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.,1_corinthians
296,"And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.",1_corinthians
297,"Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.",1_corinthians
298,"And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.",1_corinthians
299,Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?,1_corinthians
300,Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?,1_corinthians
301,But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.,1_corinthians
302,"Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.",1_corinthians
303,"And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.",1_corinthians
304,"And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.",1_corinthians
305,"Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,",1_corinthians
306,"Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;",1_corinthians
307,"Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;",1_corinthians
308,"Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.",1_corinthians
309,"Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.",1_corinthians
310,"For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.",1_corinthians
311,"But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.",1_corinthians
312,"When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.",1_corinthians
313,"For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.",1_corinthians
314,"And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.",1_corinthians
315,"Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy.",1_corinthians
316,"For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.",1_corinthians
317,"But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.",1_corinthians
318,He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.,1_corinthians
319,"I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.",1_corinthians
320,"Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?",1_corinthians
321,"And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?",1_corinthians
322,"For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?",1_corinthians
323,"So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air.",1_corinthians
324,"There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification.",1_corinthians
325,"Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me.",1_corinthians
326,"Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church.",1_corinthians
327,Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret.,1_corinthians
328,"For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.",1_corinthians
329,"What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.",1_corinthians
330,"Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?",1_corinthians
331,"For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.",1_corinthians
332,"I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:",1_corinthians
333,"Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.",1_corinthians
334,"Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men.",1_corinthians
335,"In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the Lord.",1_corinthians
336,"Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.",1_corinthians
337,"If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?",1_corinthians
338,"But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:",1_corinthians
339,"And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.",1_corinthians
340,"How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, everyone of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.",1_corinthians
341,"If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.",1_corinthians
342,"But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.",1_corinthians
343,"Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.",1_corinthians
344,"If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace.",1_corinthians
345,"For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.",1_corinthians
346,And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.,1_corinthians
347,"For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.",1_corinthians
348,"Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law.",1_corinthians
349,"And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.",1_corinthians
350,What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only?,1_corinthians
351,"If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord.",1_corinthians
352,"But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.",1_corinthians
353,"Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.",1_corinthians
354,Let all things be done decently and in order.,1_corinthians
355,"Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;",1_corinthians
356,"By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.",1_corinthians
357,"For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;",1_corinthians
358,"And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:",1_corinthians
359,"And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:",1_corinthians
360,"After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.",1_corinthians
361,"After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.",1_corinthians
362,"And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.",1_corinthians
363,"For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.",1_corinthians
364,"But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.",1_corinthians
365,"Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.",1_corinthians
366,"Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?",1_corinthians
367,"But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:",1_corinthians
368,"And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.",1_corinthians
369,"Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.",1_corinthians
370,"For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:",1_corinthians
371,"And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.",1_corinthians
372,Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.,1_corinthians
373,"If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.",1_corinthians
374,"But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.",1_corinthians
375,"For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.",1_corinthians
376,"For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.",1_corinthians
377,But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.,1_corinthians
378,"Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.",1_corinthians
379,"For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.",1_corinthians
380,The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.,1_corinthians
381,"For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith, all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.",1_corinthians
382,"And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.",1_corinthians
383,"Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?",1_corinthians
384,And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?,1_corinthians
385,"I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.",1_corinthians
386,"If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.",1_corinthians
387,Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.,1_corinthians
388,"Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.",1_corinthians
389,"But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?",1_corinthians
390,"Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:",1_corinthians
391,"And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain:",1_corinthians
392,"But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.",1_corinthians
393,"All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.",1_corinthians
394,"There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.",1_corinthians
395,"There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.",1_corinthians
396,So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:,1_corinthians
397,It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:,1_corinthians
398,"It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.",1_corinthians
399,"And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.",1_corinthians
400,"Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.",1_corinthians
401,"The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven.",1_corinthians
402,"As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.",1_corinthians
403,"And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.",1_corinthians

15,that is why I am eager to preach the gospel also to you in Rome.    II. Humanity Lost without the Gospel  God’s Power for Salvation.,romans
16,"For I am not ashamed of the gospel. It is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes: for Jew first, and then Greek.",romans
17,"For in it is revealed the righteousness of God from faith to faith;  as it is written, “The one who is righteous by faith will live.”    Punishment of Idolaters.",romans
18,The wrath  of God  is indeed being revealed from heaven against every impiety and wickedness  of those who suppress the truth by their wickedness.,romans
19,"For what can be known about God is evident to them, because God made it evident to them.",romans
20,"Ever since the creation of the world, his invisible attributes of eternal power and divinity have been able to be understood and perceived in what he has made.  As a result, they have no excuse;",romans
21,"for although they knew God they did not accord him glory as God or give him thanks. Instead, they became vain in their reasoning, and their senseless minds were darkened.",romans
22,"While claiming to be wise,  they became fools",romans
23,and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for the likeness of an image of mortal man or of birds or of four-legged animals or of snakes.,romans
24,"Therefore, God handed them over to impurity through the lusts of their hearts  for the mutual degradation of their bodies.",romans
25,"They exchanged the truth of God for a lie and revered and worshiped the creature rather than the creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.",romans
26,"Therefore, God handed them over to degrading passions. Their females exchanged natural relations for unnatural,",romans
27,and the males likewise gave up natural relations with females and burned with lust for one another. Males did shameful things with males and thus received in their own persons the due penalty for their perversity.,romans
28,"And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God handed them over to their undiscerning mind to do what is improper.",romans
29,"They are filled with every form of wickedness, evil, greed, and malice; full of envy, murder, rivalry, treachery, and spite. They are gossips",romans
30,"and scandalmongers and they hate God. They are insolent, haughty, boastful, ingenious in their wickedness, and rebellious toward their parents.",romans
31,"They are senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless.",romans
32,"Although they know the just decree of God that all who practice such things deserve death, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them.",romans
33,"Therefore, you are without excuse,  every one of you who passes judgment.  For by the standard by which you judge another you condemn yourself, since you, the judge, do the very same things.",romans
34,We know that the judgment of God on those who do such things is true.,romans
35,"Do you suppose, then, you who judge those who engage in such things and yet do them yourself, that you will escape the judgment of God?",romans
36,"Or do you hold his priceless kindness, forbearance, and patience in low esteem, unaware that the kindness of God would lead you to repentance?",romans
37,"By your stubbornness and impenitent heart,  you are storing up wrath for yourself for the day of wrath and revelation of the just judgment of God,",romans
38,who will repay everyone according to his works:,romans

43,There is no partiality with God.    Judgment by the Interior Law.,romans
44,"All who sin outside the law will also perish without reference to it, and all who sin under the law will be judged in accordance with it.",romans
45,"For it is not those who hear the law who are just in the sight of God; rather, those who observe the law will be justified.",romans
46,"For when the Gentiles who do not have the law by nature observe the prescriptions of the law, they are a law for themselves even though they do not have the law.",romans
47,"They show that the demands of the law are written in their hearts,  while their conscience also bears witness and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even defend them",romans
48,"on the day when, according to my gospel, God will judge people’s hidden works through Christ Jesus.    Judgment by the Mosaic Law.",romans
49,Now if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast of God,romans
50,"and know his will and are able to discern what is important since you are instructed from the law,",romans
51,"and if you are confident that you are a guide for the blind and a light for those in darkness,",romans
52,"that you are a trainer of the foolish and teacher of the simple,  because in the law you have the formulation of knowledge and truth—",romans
53,"then you who teach another, are you failing to teach yourself? You who preach against stealing, do you steal?",romans
54,"You who forbid adultery, do you commit adultery? You who detest idols, do you rob temples?",romans
55,"You who boast of the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?",romans
56,"For, as it is written, “Because of you the name of God is reviled among the Gentiles.”",romans
57,"Circumcision, to be sure, has value if you observe the law; but if you break the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.",romans
58,"Again, if an uncircumcised man keeps the precepts of the law, will he not be considered circumcised?",romans
59,"Indeed, those who are physically uncircumcised but carry out the law will pass judgment on you, with your written law and circumcision, who break the law.",romans
60,"One is not a Jew outwardly. True circumcision is not outward, in the flesh.",romans
61,"Rather, one is a Jew inwardly, and circumcision is of the heart, in the spirit, not the letter; his praise is not from human beings but from God.",romans
62,What advantage is there then in being a Jew? Or what is the value of circumcision?,romans
63,"Much, in every respect. [For] in the first place, they were entrusted with the utterances of God.",romans
64,What if some were unfaithful? Will their infidelity nullify the fidelity of God?,romans
65,"Of course not! God must be true, though every human being is a liar,  as it is written:    “That you may be justified in your words,  and conquer when you are judged.”",romans
66,"But if our wickedness provides proof of God’s righteousness, what can we say? Is God unjust, humanly speaking, to inflict his wrath?",romans
67,Of course not! For how else is God to judge the world?,romans
68,"But if God’s truth redounds to his glory through my falsehood, why am I still being condemned as a sinner?",romans
69,And why not say—as we are accused and as some claim we say—that we should do evil that good may come of it? Their penalty is what they deserve.    Universal Bondage to Sin.,romans
70,"Well, then, are we better off? Not entirely, for we have already brought the charge against Jews and Greeks alike that they are all under the domination of sin,",romans
71,"as it is written:    “There is no one just, not one,",romans
72,"there is no one who understands,    there is no one who seeks God.",romans
73,"All have gone astray; all alike are worthless;    there is not one who does good,  [there is not] even one.",romans
74,Their throats are open graves;    they deceive with their tongues;  the venom of asps is on their lips;,romans
75,their mouths are full of bitter cursing.,romans
76,Their feet are quick to shed blood;,romans
77,"ruin and misery are in their ways,",romans
78,and the way of peace they know not.,romans
79,There is no fear of God before their eyes.”,romans
80,"Now we know that what the law  says is addressed to those under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world stand accountable to God,",romans
81,since no human being will be justified in his sight  by observing the law; for through the law comes consciousness of sin.    III. Justification through Faith in Christ  Justification apart from the Law.,romans
82,"But now  the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, though testified to by the law and the prophets,",romans
83,the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction;,romans
84,all have sinned and are deprived of the glory of God.,romans
85,"They are justified freely by his grace through the redemption in Christ Jesus,",romans
86,"whom God set forth as an expiation,  through faith, by his blood, to prove his righteousness because of the forgiveness of sins previously committed,",romans
87,"through the forbearance of God—to prove his righteousness in the present time, that he might be righteous and justify the one who has faith in Jesus.",romans
88,"What occasion is there then for boasting?  It is ruled out. On what principle, that of works? No, rather on the principle of faith.",romans
89,For we consider that a person is justified by faith apart from works of the law.,romans
90,"Does God belong to Jews alone? Does he not belong to Gentiles, too? Yes, also to Gentiles,",romans
91,for God is one and will justify the circumcised on the basis of faith and the uncircumcised through faith.,romans
92,"Are we then annulling the law by this faith? Of course not!  On the contrary, we are supporting the law.",romans
93,"What then can we say that Abraham found, our ancestor according to the flesh?",romans
94,"Indeed, if Abraham was justified on the basis of his works, he has reason to boast; but this was not so in the sight of God.",romans
95,"For what does the scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”",romans
96,"A worker’s wage is credited not as a gift, but as something due.",romans
97,"But when one does not work, yet believes in the one who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness.",romans
98,So also David declares the blessedness of the person to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:,romans
99,“Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven    and whose sins are covered.,romans
100,Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord does not record.”,romans
101,"Does this blessedness  apply only to the circumcised, or to the uncircumcised as well? Now we assert that “faith was credited to Abraham as righteousness.”",romans
102,"Under what circumstances was it credited? Was he circumcised or not? He was not circumcised, but uncircumcised.",romans
103,"And he received the sign of circumcision as a seal on the righteousness received through faith while he was uncircumcised. Thus he was to be the father of all the uncircumcised who believe, so that to them [also] righteousness might be credited,",romans
104,"as well as the father of the circumcised who not only are circumcised, but also follow the path of faith that our father Abraham walked while still uncircumcised.    Inheritance through Faith.",romans
105,"It was not through the law that the promise was made to Abraham and his descendants that he would inherit the world, but through the righteousness that comes from faith.",romans
106,"For if those who adhere to the law are the heirs, faith is null and the promise is void.",romans
107,"For the law produces wrath;  but where there is no law, neither is there violation.",romans
108,"For this reason, it depends on faith, so that it may be a gift, and the promise may be guaranteed to all his descendants, not to those who only adhere to the law but to those who follow the faith of Abraham, who is the father of all of us,",romans
109,"as it is written, “I have made you father of many nations.” He is our father in the sight of God, in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls into being what does not exist.",romans
110,"He believed, hoping against hope,  that he would become “the father of many nations,” according to what was said, “Thus shall your descendants be.”",romans
111,He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body as [already] dead (for he was almost a hundred years old) and the dead womb of Sarah.,romans
112,"He did not doubt God’s promise in unbelief;  rather, he was empowered by faith and gave glory to God",romans
113,and was fully convinced that what he had promised he was also able to do.,romans
114,That is why “it was credited to him as righteousness.”,romans
115,But it was not for him alone that it was written that “it was credited to him”;,romans
116,"it was also for us, to whom it will be credited, who believe in the one who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead,",romans
117,who was handed over for our transgressions and was raised for our justification.,romans
118,"Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace  with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,",romans
119,"through whom we have gained access [by faith] to this grace in which we stand, and we boast in hope of the glory of God.",romans
120,"Not only that, but we even boast of our afflictions, knowing that affliction produces endurance,",romans
121,"and endurance, proven character, and proven character, hope,",romans
122,"and hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out into our hearts through the holy Spirit that has been given to us.",romans
123,"For Christ, while we were still helpless, yet died at the appointed time for the ungodly.",romans
124,"Indeed, only with difficulty does one die for a just person, though perhaps for a good person one might even find courage to die.",romans
125,But God proves his love for us in that while we were still sinners Christ died for us.,romans
126,"How much more then, since we are now justified by his blood, will we be saved through him from the wrath.",romans
127,"Indeed, if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, how much more, once reconciled, will we be saved by his life.",romans
128,"Not only that, but we also boast of God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.    Humanity’s Sin through Adam.",romans
129,"Therefore, just as through one person sin entered the world,  and through sin, death, and thus death came to all, inasmuch as all sinned—",romans
130,"for up to the time of the law, sin was in the world, though sin is not accounted when there is no law.",romans
131,"But death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who did not sin after the pattern of the trespass of Adam, who is the type of the one who was to come.    Grace and Life through Christ.",romans
132,"But the gift is not like the transgression. For if by that one person’s transgression the many died, how much more did the grace of God and the gracious gift of the one person Jesus Christ overflow for the many.",romans
133,"And the gift is not like the result of the one person’s sinning. For after one sin there was the judgment that brought condemnation; but the gift, after many transgressions, brought acquittal.",romans
134,"For if, by the transgression of one person, death came to reign through that one, how much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of justification come to reign in life through the one person Jesus Christ.",romans
135,"In conclusion, just as through one transgression condemnation came upon all, so through one righteous act acquittal and life came to all.",romans
136,"For just as through the disobedience of one person the many were made sinners, so through the obedience of one the many will be made righteous.",romans
137,"The law entered in  so that transgression might increase but, where sin increased, grace overflowed all the more,",romans
138,"so that, as sin reigned in death, grace also might reign through justification for eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.",romans
139,What then shall we say? Shall we persist in sin that grace may abound? Of course not!,romans
140,How can we who died to sin yet live in it?,romans
141,Or are you unaware that we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?,romans
142,"We were indeed buried with him through baptism into death, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might live in newness of life.",romans
143,"For if we have grown into union with him through a death like his, we shall also be united with him in the resurrection.",romans
144,"We know that our old self was crucified with him, so that our sinful body might be done away with, that we might no longer be in slavery to sin.",romans
145,For a dead person has been absolved from sin.,romans
146,"If, then, we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him.",romans
147,"We know that Christ, raised from the dead, dies no more; death no longer has power over him.",romans
148,"As to his death, he died to sin once and for all; as to his life, he lives for God.",romans
149,"Consequently, you too must think of yourselves as [being] dead to sin and living for God in Christ Jesus.",romans
150,"Therefore, sin must not reign over your mortal bodies so that you obey their desires.",romans
151,"And do not present the parts of your bodies to sin as weapons for wickedness, but present yourselves to God as raised from the dead to life and the parts of your bodies to God as weapons for righteousness.",romans
152,"For sin is not to have any power over you, since you are not under the law but under grace.",romans
153,What then? Shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace? Of course not!,romans
154,"Do you not know that if you present yourselves to someone as obedient slaves,  you are slaves of the one you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness?",romans
155,"But thanks be to God that, although you were once slaves of sin, you have become obedient from the heart to the pattern of teaching to which you were entrusted.",romans
156,"Freed from sin, you have become slaves of righteousness.",romans
157,"I am speaking in human terms because of the weakness of your nature. For just as you presented the parts of your bodies as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness for lawlessness, so now present them as slaves to righteousness for sanctification.",romans
158,"For when you were slaves of sin, you were free from righteousness.",romans
159,But what profit did you get then from the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death.,romans
160,"But now that you have been freed from sin and have become slaves of God, the benefit that you have leads to sanctification,  and its end is eternal life.",romans
161,"For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.",romans
162,"Are you unaware, brothers (for I am speaking to people who know the law), that the law has jurisdiction over one as long as one lives?",romans
163,"Thus a married woman is bound by law to her living husband; but if her husband dies, she is released from the law in respect to her husband.",romans
164,"Consequently, while her husband is alive she will be called an adulteress if she consorts with another man. But if her husband dies she is free from that law, and she is not an adulteress if she consorts with another man.",romans
165,"In the same way, my brothers, you also were put to death to the law through the body of Christ, so that you might belong to another, to the one who was raised from the dead in order that we might bear fruit for God.",romans
166,"For when we were in the flesh, our sinful passions, awakened by the law, worked in our members to bear fruit for death.",romans
167,"But now we are released from the law, dead to what held us captive, so that we may serve in the newness of the spirit and not under the obsolete letter.    Acquaintance with Sin through the Law.",romans
168,"What then can we say? That the law is sin? Of course not!  Yet I did not know sin except through the law, and I did not know what it is to covet except that the law said, “You shall not covet.”",romans
169,"But sin, finding an opportunity in the commandment, produced in me every kind of covetousness. Apart from the law sin is dead.",romans
170,"I once lived outside the law, but when the commandment came, sin became alive;",romans
171,"then I died, and the commandment that was for life turned out to be death for me.",romans
172,"For sin, seizing an opportunity in the commandment, deceived me and through it put me to death.",romans
173,"So then the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good.    Sin and Death.",romans
174,"Did the good, then, become death for me? Of course not! Sin, in order that it might be shown to be sin, worked death in me through the good, so that sin might become sinful beyond measure through the commandment.",romans
175,"We know that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold into slavery to sin.",romans
176,"What I do, I do not understand. For I do not do what I want, but I do what I hate.",romans
177,"Now if I do what I do not want, I concur that the law is good.",romans
178,"So now it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells in me.",romans
179,"For I know that good does not dwell in me, that is, in my flesh. The willing is ready at hand, but doing the good is not.",romans
180,"For I do not do the good I want, but I do the evil I do not want.",romans
181,"Now if [I] do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells in me.",romans
182,"So, then, I discover the principle that when I want to do right, evil is at hand.",romans
183,"For I take delight in the law of God, in my inner self,",romans
184,"but I see in my members another principle at war with the law of my mind, taking me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members.",romans
185,Miserable one that I am! Who will deliver me from this mortal body?,romans
186,"Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord. Therefore, I myself, with my mind, serve the law of God but, with my flesh, the law of sin.",romans
187,"Hence, now there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.",romans
188,For the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed you from the law of sin and death.,romans
189,"For what the law, weakened by the flesh, was powerless to do, this God has done: by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for the sake of sin, he condemned sin in the flesh,",romans
190,"so that the righteous decree of the law might be fulfilled in us, who live not according to the flesh but according to the spirit.",romans
191,"For those who live according to the flesh are concerned with the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the spirit with the things of the spirit.",romans
192,"The concern of the flesh is death, but the concern of the spirit is life and peace.",romans
193,"For the concern of the flesh is hostility toward God; it does not submit to the law of God, nor can it;",romans
194,and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.,romans
195,"But you are not in the flesh; on the contrary, you are in the spirit, if only the Spirit of God dwells in you. Whoever does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him.",romans
196,"But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the spirit is alive because of righteousness.",romans
197,"If the Spirit of the one who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, the one who raised Christ from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies also, through his Spirit that dwells in you.",romans
198,"Consequently, brothers, we are not debtors to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.",romans
199,"For if you live according to the flesh, you will die, but if by the spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.    Children of God through Adoption.",romans
200,For those who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God.,romans
201,"For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you received a spirit of adoption, through which we cry, “Abba,  Father!”",romans
202,"The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God,",romans
203,"and if children, then heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, if only we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him.    Destiny of Glory.",romans
204,I consider that the sufferings of this present time are as nothing compared with the glory to be revealed for us.,romans
205,For creation awaits with eager expectation the revelation of the children of God;,romans
206,"for creation was made subject to futility, not of its own accord but because of the one who subjected it,  in hope",romans
207,that creation itself would be set free from slavery to corruption and share in the glorious freedom of the children of God.,romans
208,We know that all creation is groaning in labor pains even until now;,romans
209,"and not only that, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, we also groan within ourselves as we wait for adoption, the redemption of our bodies.",romans
210,For in hope we were saved. Now hope that sees for itself is not hope. For who hopes for what one sees?,romans
211,"But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait with endurance.",romans
212,"In the same way, the Spirit too comes to the aid of our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we ought, but the Spirit itself intercedes with inexpressible groanings.",romans
213,"And the one who searches hearts knows what is the intention of the Spirit, because it intercedes for the holy ones according to God’s will.    God’s Indomitable Love in Christ.",romans
214,"We know that all things work for good for those who love God,  who are called according to his purpose.",romans
215,"For those he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, so that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.",romans
216,And those he predestined he also called; and those he called he also justified; and those he justified he also glorified.,romans
217,"What then shall we say to this? If God is for us, who can be against us?",romans
218,"He who did not spare his own Son but handed him over for us all, how will he not also give us everything else along with him?",romans
219,Who will bring a charge against God’s chosen ones? It is God who acquits us.,romans
220,"Who will condemn? It is Christ [Jesus] who died, rather, was raised, who also is at the right hand of God, who indeed intercedes for us.",romans
221,"What will separate us from the love of Christ? Will anguish, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or the sword?",romans
222,As it is written:    “For your sake we are being slain all the day;  we are looked upon as sheep to be slaughtered.”,romans
223,"No, in all these things we conquer overwhelmingly through him who loved us.",romans
224,"For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor present things,  nor future things, nor powers,",romans
225,"nor height, nor depth,  nor any other creature will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.",romans
226,"I speak the truth in Christ, I do not lie; my conscience joins with the holy Spirit in bearing me witness",romans
227,that I have great sorrow and constant anguish in my heart.,romans
228,"For I could wish that I myself were accursed and separated from Christ for the sake of my brothers, my kin according to the flesh.",romans
229,"They are Israelites; theirs the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises;",romans
230,"theirs the patriarchs, and from them, according to the flesh, is the Messiah. God who is over all  be blessed forever. Amen.    God’s Free Choice.",romans
231,"But it is not that the word of God has failed. For not all who are of Israel are Israel,",romans
232,nor are they all children of Abraham because they are his descendants; but “It is through Isaac that descendants shall bear your name.”,romans
233,"This means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as descendants.",romans
234,"For this is the wording of the promise, “About this time I shall return and Sarah will have a son.”",romans
235,"And not only that,  but also when Rebecca had conceived children by one husband, our father Isaac—",romans
236,"before they had yet been born or had done anything, good or bad, in order that God’s elective plan might continue,",romans
237,"not by works but by his call—she was told, “The older shall serve the younger.”",romans
238,As it is written:    “I loved Jacob  but hated Esau.”,romans
239,What then are we to say? Is there injustice on the part of God? Of course not!,romans
240,"For he says to Moses:    “I will show mercy to whom I will,  I will take pity on whom I will.”",romans
241,"So it depends not upon a person’s will or exertion, but upon God, who shows mercy.",romans
242,"For the scripture says to Pharaoh, “This is why I have raised you up, to show my power through you that my name may be proclaimed throughout the earth.”",romans
243,"Consequently, he has mercy upon whom he wills,  and he hardens whom he wills.",romans
244,"You will say to me then, “Why (then) does he still find fault? For who can oppose his will?”",romans
245,"But who indeed are you, a human being, to talk back to God?  Will what is made say to its maker, “Why have you created me so?”",romans
246,"Or does not the potter have a right over the clay, to make out of the same lump one vessel for a noble purpose and another for an ignoble one?",romans
247,"What if God, wishing to show his wrath and make known his power, has endured with much patience the vessels of wrath made for destruction?",romans
248,"This was to make known the riches of his glory to the vessels of mercy, which he has prepared previously for glory,",romans
249,"namely, us whom he has called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles.    Witness of the Prophets.",romans
250,"As indeed he says in Hosea:    “Those who were not my people I will call ‘my people,’  and her who was not beloved  I will call ‘beloved.’",romans
251,"And in the very place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’    there they shall be called children of the living God.”",romans
252,"And Isaiah cries out concerning Israel, “Though the number of the Israelites were like the sand of the sea, only a remnant will be saved;",romans
253,for decisively and quickly will the Lord execute sentence upon the earth.”,romans
254,"And as Isaiah predicted:    “Unless the Lord of hosts had left us descendants,  we would have become like Sodom  and have been made like Gomorrah.”  Righteousness Based on Faith.",romans
255,"What then shall we say? That Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have achieved it, that is, righteousness that comes from faith;",romans
256,"but that Israel, who pursued the law of righteousness, did not attain to that law?",romans
257,"Why not? Because they did it not by faith, but as if it could be done by works.  They stumbled over the stone that causes stumbling,",romans
258,"as it is written:    “Behold, I am laying a stone in Zion  that will make people stumble  and a rock that will make them fall,  and whoever believes in him shall not be put to shame.”",romans
259,"Brothers, my heart’s desire and prayer to God on their behalf is for salvation.",romans
260,"I testify with regard to them that they have zeal for God, but it is not discerning.",romans
261,"For, in their unawareness of the righteousness that comes from God and their attempt to establish their own [righteousness], they did not submit to the righteousness of God.",romans
262,For Christ is the end  of the law for the justification of everyone who has faith.,romans
263,"Moses writes about the righteousness that comes from [the] law, “The one who does these things will live by them.”",romans
264,"But the righteousness that comes from faith says,  “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will go up into heaven?’ (that is, to bring Christ down)",romans
265,"or ‘Who will go down into the abyss?’ (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).”",romans
266,"But what does it say?    “The word is near you,  in your mouth and in your heart”  (that is, the word of faith that we preach),",romans
267,"for, if you confess  with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.",romans
268,"For one believes with the heart and so is justified, and one confesses with the mouth and so is saved.",romans
269,"For the scripture says, “No one who believes in him will be put to shame.”",romans
270,"For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is Lord of all, enriching all who call upon him.",romans
271,For “everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”,romans
272,But how can they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how can they believe in him of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone to preach?,romans
273,"And how can people preach unless they are sent? As it is written,  “How beautiful are the feet of those who bring [the] good news!”",romans
274,"But not everyone has heeded the good news; for Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed what was heard from us?”",romans
275,"Thus faith comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes through the word of Christ.",romans
276,"But I ask, did they not hear? Certainly they did; for    “Their voice has gone forth to all the earth,  and their words to the ends of the world.”",romans
277,"But I ask, did not Israel understand?  First Moses says:    “I will make you jealous of those who are not a nation;  with a senseless nation I will make you angry.”",romans
278,Then Isaiah speaks boldly and says:    “I was found [by] those who were not seeking me;  I revealed myself to those who were not asking for me.”,romans
279,"But regarding Israel he says, “All day long I stretched out my hands to a disobedient and contentious people.”",romans
280,"I ask, then, has God rejected his people? Of course not!  For I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.",romans
281,"God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the scripture says about Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel?",romans
282,"“Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have torn down your altars, and I alone am left, and they are seeking my life.”",romans
283,But what is God’s response to him? “I have left for myself seven thousand men who have not knelt to Baal.”,romans
284,"So also at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace.",romans
285,"But if by grace, it is no longer because of works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace.",romans
286,"What then? What Israel was seeking it did not attain, but the elect attained it; the rest were hardened,",romans
287,"as it is written:    “God gave them a spirit of deep sleep,  eyes that should not see  and ears that should not hear,  down to this very day.”",romans
288,"And David says:    “Let their table become a snare and a trap,  a stumbling block and a retribution for them;",romans
289,"let their eyes grow dim so that they may not see,    and keep their backs bent forever.”  The Gentiles’ Salvation.",romans
290,"Hence I ask, did they stumble so as to fall? Of course not! But through their transgression salvation has come to the Gentiles, so as to make them jealous.",romans
291,"Now if their transgression is enrichment for the world, and if their diminished number is enrichment for the Gentiles, how much more their full number.",romans
292,"Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I glory in my ministry",romans
293,in order to make my race jealous and thus save some of them.,romans
294,"For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?",romans
295,"If the firstfruits are holy, so is the whole batch of dough; and if the root is holy, so are the branches.",romans
296,"But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, a wild olive shoot, were grafted in their place and have come to share in the rich root of the olive tree,",romans
297,"do not boast against the branches. If you do boast, consider that you do not support the root; the root supports you.",romans
298,"Indeed you will say, “Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.”",romans
299,"That is so. They were broken off because of unbelief, but you are there because of faith. So do not become haughty, but stand in awe.",romans
300,"For if God did not spare the natural branches, [perhaps] he will not spare you either.",romans
301,"See, then, the kindness and severity of God: severity toward those who fell, but God’s kindness to you, provided you remain in his kindness; otherwise you too will be cut off.",romans
302,"And they also, if they do not remain in unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.",romans
303,"For if you were cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated one, how much more will they who belong to it by nature be grafted back into their own olive tree.    God’s Irrevocable Call.",romans
304,"I do not want you to be unaware of this mystery, brothers, so that you will not become wise [in] your own estimation: a hardening has come upon Israel in part, until the full number of the Gentiles comes in,",romans
305,"and thus all Israel will be saved,  as it is written:    “The deliverer will come out of Zion,  he will turn away godlessness from Jacob;",romans
306,and this is my covenant with them    when I take away their sins.”,romans
307,"In respect to the gospel, they are enemies on your account; but in respect to election, they are beloved because of the patriarchs.",romans
308,For the gifts and the call of God are irrevocable.    Triumph of God’s Mercy.,romans
309,"Just as you once disobeyed God but have now received mercy because of their disobedience,",romans
310,"so they have now disobeyed in order that, by virtue of the mercy shown to you, they too may [now] receive mercy.",romans
311,"For God delivered all to disobedience, that he might have mercy upon all.",romans
312,"Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How inscrutable are his judgments and how unsearchable his ways!",romans
313,“For who has known the mind of the Lord    or who has been his counselor?”,romans
314,“Or who has given him anything    that he may be repaid?”,romans
315,"For from him and through him and for him are all things. To him be glory forever. Amen.        I urge you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God, your spiritual worship.",romans
316,"Do not conform yourselves to this age but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and pleasing and perfect.    Many Parts in One Body.",romans
317,"For by the grace given to me I tell everyone among you not to think of himself more highly than one ought to think, but to think soberly, each according to the measure of faith that God has apportioned.",romans
318,"For as in one body we have many parts, and all the parts do not have the same function,",romans
319,"so we, though many, are one body in Christ  and individually parts of one another.",romans
320,"Since we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us exercise them:  if prophecy, in proportion to the faith;",romans
321,"if ministry, in ministering; if one is a teacher, in teaching;",romans
322,"if one exhorts, in exhortation; if one contributes, in generosity; if one is over others,  with diligence; if one does acts of mercy, with cheerfulness.    Mutual Love.",romans
323,"Let love be sincere; hate what is evil, hold on to what is good;",romans
324,love one another with mutual affection; anticipate one another in showing honor.,romans

328,"Bless those who persecute [you],  bless and do not curse them.",romans
329,"Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep.",romans
330,Have the same regard for one another; do not be haughty but associate with the lowly; do not be wise in your own estimation.,romans
331,Do not repay anyone evil for evil; be concerned for what is noble in the sight of all.,romans
332,"If possible, on your part, live at peace with all.",romans
333,"Beloved, do not look for revenge but leave room for the wrath; for it is written, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.”",romans
334,"Rather, “if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink; for by so doing you will heap burning coals upon his head.”",romans
335,Do not be conquered by evil but conquer evil with good.,romans
336,"Let every person be subordinate to the higher authorities, for there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been established by God.",romans
337,"Therefore, whoever resists authority opposes what God has appointed, and those who oppose it will bring judgment upon themselves.",romans
338,"For rulers are not a cause of fear to good conduct, but to evil.  Do you wish to have no fear of authority? Then do what is good and you will receive approval from it,",romans
339,"for it is a servant of God for your good. But if you do evil, be afraid, for it does not bear the sword without purpose; it is the servant of God to inflict wrath on the evildoer.",romans
340,"Therefore, it is necessary to be subject not only because of the wrath but also because of conscience.",romans
341,"This is why you also pay taxes, for the authorities are ministers of God, devoting themselves to this very thing.",romans
342,"Pay to all their dues, taxes to whom taxes are due, toll to whom toll is due, respect to whom respect is due, honor to whom honor is due.    Love Fulfills the Law.",romans
343,"Owe nothing to anyone, except to love one another; for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law.",romans
344,"The commandments, “You shall not commit adultery; you shall not kill; you shall not steal; you shall not covet,” and whatever other commandment there may be, are summed up in this saying, [namely] “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”",romans
345,"Love does no evil to the neighbor; hence, love is the fulfillment of the law.    Awareness of the End of Time.",romans
346,And do this because you know the time; it is the hour now for you to awake from sleep. For our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed;,romans
347,"the night is advanced, the day is at hand. Let us then throw off the works of darkness [and] put on the armor of light;",romans
348,"let us conduct ourselves properly as in the day,  not in orgies and drunkenness, not in promiscuity and licentiousness, not in rivalry and jealousy.",romans
349,"But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the desires of the flesh.",romans
350,"Welcome anyone who is weak in faith,  but not for disputes over opinions.",romans
351,"One person believes that one may eat anything, while the weak person eats only vegetables.",romans
352,"The one who eats must not despise the one who abstains, and the one who abstains must not pass judgment on the one who eats; for God has welcomed him.",romans
353,"Who are you to pass judgment on someone else’s servant? Before his own master he stands or falls. And he will be upheld, for the Lord is able to make him stand.",romans
354,"[For] one person considers one day more important than another, while another person considers all days alike.  Let everyone be fully persuaded in his own mind.",romans
355,"Whoever observes the day, observes it for the Lord. Also whoever eats, eats for the Lord, since he gives thanks to God; while whoever abstains, abstains for the Lord and gives thanks to God.",romans
356,"None of us lives for oneself, and no one dies for oneself.",romans
357,"For if we live, we live for the Lord,  and if we die, we die for the Lord; so then, whether we live or die, we are the Lord’s.",romans
358,"For this is why Christ died and came to life, that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living.",romans
359,"Why then do you judge your brother? Or you, why do you look down on your brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of God;",romans
360,"for it is written:    “As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bend before me,  and every tongue shall give praise to God.”",romans
361,So [then] each of us shall give an account of himself [to God].    Consideration for the Weak Conscience.,romans
362,"Then let us no longer judge one another, but rather resolve never to put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of a brother.",romans
363,"I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself; still, it is unclean for someone who thinks it unclean.",romans
364,"If your brother is being hurt by what you eat, your conduct is no longer in accord with love. Do not because of your food destroy him for whom Christ died.",romans
365,So do not let your good be reviled.,romans
366,"For the kingdom of God is not a matter of food and drink, but of righteousness, peace, and joy in the holy Spirit;",romans
367,whoever serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and approved by others.,romans
368,Let us  then pursue what leads to peace and to building up one another.,romans
369,"For the sake of food, do not destroy the work of God.  Everything is indeed clean, but it is wrong for anyone to become a stumbling block by eating;",romans
370,it is good not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that causes your brother to stumble.,romans
371,Keep the faith [that] you have to yourself in the presence of God; blessed is the one who does not condemn himself for what he approves.,romans
372,"But whoever has doubts is condemned if he eats, because this is not from faith; for whatever is not from faith is sin.",romans
373,We who are strong ought to put up with the failings of the weak and not to please ourselves;,romans
374,"let each of us please our neighbor for the good, for building up.",romans
375,"For Christ did not please himself; but, as it is written,  “The insults of those who insult you fall upon me.”",romans
376,"For whatever was written previously was written for our instruction, that by endurance and by the encouragement of the scriptures we might have hope.",romans
377,"May the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to think in harmony  with one another, in keeping with Christ Jesus,",romans
378,that with one accord you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.    God’s Fidelity and Mercy.,romans
379,"Welcome one another, then, as Christ welcomed you, for the glory of God.",romans
380,"For I say that Christ became a minister of the circumcised to show God’s truthfulness, to confirm the promises to the patriarchs,",romans
381,"but so that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written:    “Therefore, I will praise you among the Gentiles  and sing praises to your name.”",romans
382,"And again it says:    “Rejoice, O Gentiles, with his people.”",romans
383,"And again:    “Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles,  and let all the peoples praise him.”",romans

386,"I myself am convinced about you, my brothers, that you yourselves are full of goodness,  filled with all knowledge, and able to admonish one another.",romans
387,"But I have written to you rather boldly in some respects to remind you, because of the grace given me by God",romans
388,"to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles in performing the priestly service of the gospel of God, so that the offering up of the Gentiles may be acceptable, sanctified by the holy Spirit.",romans
389,"In Christ Jesus, then, I have reason to boast in what pertains to God.",romans
390,"For I will not dare to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me to lead the Gentiles to obedience by word and deed,",romans
391,"by the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit [of God], so that from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum  I have finished preaching the gospel of Christ.",romans
392,"Thus I aspire  to proclaim the gospel not where Christ has already been named, so that I do not build on another’s foundation,",romans

396,"I hope to see you in passing as I go to Spain and to be sent on my way there by you, after I have enjoyed being with you for a time.",romans
397,"Now, however, I am going to Jerusalem to minister to the holy ones.",romans
398,For Macedonia and Achaia  have decided to make some contribution for the poor among the holy ones in Jerusalem;,romans
399,"they decided to do it, and in fact they are indebted to them, for if the Gentiles have come to share in their spiritual blessings, they ought also to serve them in material blessings.",romans
400,"So when I have completed this and safely handed over this contribution to them, I shall set out by way of you to Spain;",romans
401,and I know that in coming to you I shall come in the fullness of Christ’s blessing.,romans
402,"I urge you, [brothers,] by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to join me in the struggle by your prayers to God on my behalf,",romans
403,"that I may be delivered from the disobedient in Judea, and that my ministry for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the holy ones,",romans

25,"Then after fourteen years I again went up to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along also.",galatians
26,"I went up in accord with a revelation, and I presented to them the gospel that I preach to the Gentiles—but privately to those of repute—so that I might not be running, or have run, in vain.",galatians
27,"Moreover, not even Titus, who was with me, although he was a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised,",galatians
28,"but because of the false brothers secretly brought in, who slipped in to spy on our freedom that we have in Christ Jesus, that they might enslave us—",galatians
29,"to them we did not submit even for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel might remain intact for you.",galatians
30,But from those who were reputed to be important (what they once were makes no difference to me; God shows no partiality)—those of repute made me add nothing.,galatians
31,"On the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter to the circumcised,",galatians
32,"for the one who worked in Peter for an apostolate to the circumcised worked also in me for the Gentiles,",galatians
33,"and when they recognized the grace bestowed upon me, James and Cephas and John, who were reputed to be pillars, gave me and Barnabas their right hands in partnership, that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised.",galatians
34,"Only, we were to be mindful of the poor, which is the very thing I was eager to do. Peter’s Inconsistency at Antioch.",galatians
35,"And when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face because he clearly was wrong.",galatians
36,"For, until some people came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles; but when they came, he began to draw back and separated himself, because he was afraid of the circumcised.",galatians
37,"And the rest of the Jews [also] acted hypocritically along with him, with the result that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy.",galatians
38,"But when I saw that they were not on the right road in line with the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in front of all, “If you, though a Jew, are living like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?”",galatians
39,"We, who are Jews by nature and not sinners from among the Gentiles,",galatians
40,"[yet] who know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified.",galatians
41,"But if, in seeking to be justified in Christ, we ourselves are found to be sinners, is Christ then a minister of sin? Of course not!",galatians
42,"But if I am building up again those things that I tore down, then I show myself to be a transgressor.",galatians
43,"For through the law I died to the law, that I might live for God. I have been crucified with Christ;",galatians
44,"yet I live, no longer I, but Christ lives in me; insofar as I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God who has loved me and given himself up for me.",galatians
45,"I do not nullify the grace of God; for if justification comes through the law, then Christ died for nothing.",galatians
46,"O stupid Galatians! Who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified?",galatians
47,"I want to learn only this from you: did you receive the Spirit from works of the law, or from faith in what you heard?",galatians
48,"Are you so stupid? After beginning with the Spirit, are you now ending with the flesh?",galatians
49,Did you experience so many things in vain?—if indeed it was in vain.,galatians
50,"Does, then, the one who supplies the Spirit to you and works mighty deeds among you do so from works of the law or from faith in what you heard?",galatians
51,"Thus Abraham “believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”",galatians
52,Realize then that it is those who have faith who are children of Abraham.,galatians
53,"Scripture, which saw in advance that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, foretold the good news to Abraham, saying, “Through you shall all the nations be blessed.”",galatians
54,"Consequently, those who have faith are blessed along with Abraham who had faith.",galatians
55,"For all who depend on works of the law are under a curse; for it is written, “Cursed be everyone who does not persevere in doing all the things written in the book of the law.”",galatians
56,"And that no one is justified before God by the law is clear, for “the one who is righteous by faith will live.”",galatians
57,"But the law does not depend on faith; rather, “the one who does these things will live by them.”",galatians
58,"Christ ransomed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written, “Cursed be everyone who hangs on a tree,”",galatians
59,"that the blessing of Abraham might be extended to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, so that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. The Law Did Not Nullify the Promise.",galatians
60,"Brothers, in human terms I say that no one can annul or amend even a human will once ratified.",galatians
61,"Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his descendant. It does not say, “And to descendants,” as referring to many, but as referring to one, “And to your descendant,” who is Christ.",galatians
62,"This is what I mean: the law, which came four hundred and thirty years afterward, does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to cancel the promise.",galatians
63,"For if the inheritance comes from the law, it is no longer from a promise; but God bestowed it on Abraham through a promise.",galatians
64,"Why, then, the law? It was added for transgressions, until the descendant came to whom the promise had been made; it was promulgated by angels at the hand of a mediator.",galatians
65,"Now there is no mediator when only one party is involved, and God is one.",galatians
66,"Is the law then opposed to the promises [of God]? Of course not! For if a law had been given that could bring life, then righteousness would in reality come from the law.",galatians
67,"But scripture confined all things under the power of sin, that through faith in Jesus Christ the promise might be given to those who believe. What Faith Has Brought Us.",galatians
68,"Before faith came, we were held in custody under law, confined for the faith that was to be revealed.",galatians
69,"Consequently, the law was our disciplinarian for Christ, that we might be justified by faith.",galatians
70,"But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a disciplinarian.",galatians
71,For through faith you are all children of God in Christ Jesus.,galatians
72,For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.,galatians
73,"There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free person, there is not male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.",galatians
74,"And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s descendant, heirs according to the promise.",galatians
75,"I mean that as long as the heir is not of age, he is no different from a slave, although he is the owner of everything,",galatians
76,but he is under the supervision of guardians and administrators until the date set by his father.,galatians
77,"In the same way we also, when we were not of age, were enslaved to the elemental powers of the world.",galatians
78,"But when the fullness of time had come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,",galatians
79,"to ransom those under the law, so that we might receive adoption.",galatians
80,"As proof that you are children, God sent the spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying out, “Abba, Father!”",galatians
81,"So you are no longer a slave but a child, and if a child then also an heir, through God. Do Not Throw This Freedom Away.",galatians
82,"At a time when you did not know God, you became slaves to things that by nature are not gods;",galatians
83,"but now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and destitute elemental powers? Do you want to be slaves to them all over again?",galatians
84,"You are observing days, months, seasons, and years.",galatians
85,I am afraid on your account that perhaps I have labored for you in vain. Appeal to Former Loyalty.,galatians
86,"I implore you, brothers, be as I am, because I have also become as you are. You did me no wrong;",galatians
87,"you know that it was because of a physical illness that I originally preached the gospel to you,",galatians
88,"and you did not show disdain or contempt because of the trial caused you by my physical condition, but rather you received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus.",galatians
89,"Where now is that blessedness of yours? Indeed, I can testify to you that, if it had been possible, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me.",galatians
90,So now have I become your enemy by telling you the truth?,galatians
91,"They show interest in you, but not in a good way; they want to isolate you, so that you may show interest in them.",galatians
92,"Now it is good to be shown interest for good reason at all times, and not only when I am with you.",galatians
93,"My children, for whom I am again in labor until Christ be formed in you!",galatians
94,"I would like to be with you now and to change my tone, for I am perplexed because of you. An Allegory on Christian Freedom.",galatians
95,"Tell me, you who want to be under the law, do you not listen to the law?",galatians
96,"For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and the other by the freeborn woman.",galatians
97,"The son of the slave woman was born naturally, the son of the freeborn through a promise.",galatians
98,"Now this is an allegory. These women represent two covenants. One was from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery; this is Hagar.",galatians
99,"Hagar represents Sinai, a mountain in Arabia; it corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery along with her children.",galatians
100,"But the Jerusalem above is freeborn, and she is our mother.",galatians
101,"For it is written: “Rejoice, you barren one who bore no children; break forth and shout, you who were not in labor; for more numerous are the children of the deserted one than of her who has a husband.”",galatians
102,"Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of the promise.",galatians
103,"But just as then the child of the flesh persecuted the child of the spirit, it is the same now.",galatians
104,But what does the scripture say? “Drive out the slave woman and her son! For the son of the slave woman shall not share the inheritance with the son” of the freeborn.,galatians
105,"Therefore, brothers, we are children not of the slave woman but of the freeborn woman.",galatians
106,For freedom Christ set us free; so stand firm and do not submit again to the yoke of slavery.,galatians
107,"It is I, Paul, who am telling you that if you have yourselves circumcised, Christ will be of no benefit to you.",galatians
108,Once again I declare to every man who has himself circumcised that he is bound to observe the entire law.,galatians
109,"You are separated from Christ, you who are trying to be justified by law; you have fallen from grace.",galatians
110,"For through the Spirit, by faith, we await the hope of righteousness.",galatians
111,"For in Christ Jesus, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything, but only faith working through love. Be Not Misled.",galatians
112,You were running well; who hindered you from following [the] truth?,galatians
113,That enticement does not come from the one who called you.,galatians
114,A little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough.,galatians
115,"I am confident of you in the Lord that you will not take a different view, and that the one who is troubling you will bear the condemnation, whoever he may be.",galatians
116,"As for me, brothers, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case, the stumbling block of the cross has been abolished.",galatians
117,Would that those who are upsetting you might also castrate themselves! Freedom for Service.,galatians
118,"For you were called for freedom, brothers. But do not use this freedom as an opportunity for the flesh; rather, serve one another through love.",galatians
119,"For the whole law is fulfilled in one statement, namely, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”",galatians
120,"But if you go on biting and devouring one another, beware that you are not consumed by one another.",galatians
121,"I say, then: live by the Spirit and you will certainly not gratify the desire of the flesh.",galatians
122,"For the flesh has desires against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; these are opposed to each other, so that you may not do what you want.",galatians
123,"But if you are guided by the Spirit, you are not under the law.",galatians
124,"Now the works of the flesh are obvious: immorality, impurity, licentiousness,",galatians
125,"idolatry, sorcery, hatreds, rivalry, jealousy, outbursts of fury, acts of selfishness, dissensions, factions,",galatians
126,"occasions of envy, drinking bouts, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.",galatians
127,"In contrast, the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness,",galatians
128,"gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law.",galatians
129,Now those who belong to Christ [Jesus] have crucified their flesh with its passions and desires.,galatians
130,"If we live in the Spirit, let us also follow the Spirit.",galatians
131,"Let us not be conceited, provoking one another, envious of one another.",galatians
132,"Brothers, even if a person is caught in some transgression, you who are spiritual should correct that one in a gentle spirit, looking to yourself, so that you also may not be tempted.",galatians
133,"Bear one another’s burdens, and so you will fulfill the law of Christ.",galatians
134,"For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he is deluding himself.",galatians
135,"Each one must examine his own work, and then he will have reason to boast with regard to himself alone, and not with regard to someone else;",galatians
136,for each will bear his own load.,galatians
137,One who is being instructed in the word should share all good things with his instructor.,galatians
138,"Make no mistake: God is not mocked, for a person will reap only what he sows,",galatians
139,"because the one who sows for his flesh will reap corruption from the flesh, but the one who sows for the spirit will reap eternal life from the spirit.",galatians
140,"Let us not grow tired of doing good, for in due time we shall reap our harvest, if we do not give up.",galatians
141,"So then, while we have the opportunity, let us do good to all, but especially to those who belong to the family of the faith. VI. Conclusion Final Appeal.",galatians
142,See with what large letters I am writing to you in my own hand!,galatians
143,"It is those who want to make a good appearance in the flesh who are trying to compel you to have yourselves circumcised, only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.",galatians
144,Not even those having themselves circumcised observe the law themselves; they only want you to be circumcised so that they may boast of your flesh.,galatians
145,"But may I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.",galatians
146,"For neither does circumcision mean anything, nor does uncircumcision, but only a new creation.",galatians
147,Peace and mercy be to all who follow this rule and to the Israel of God.,galatians
148,"From now on, let no one make troubles for me; for I bear the marks of Jesus on my body.",galatians
149,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.",galatians
0,"1:1 There are two ways, one of life and one of death! and there is a great difference between the two ways.",didache
1,"The way of life is this: First, you shall love God who made you. And second, love your neighbor as yourself, and do not do to another what you would not want done to you.",didache
2,"The meaning of these sayings is this: Bless those who curse you, and pray for your enemies, and fast for those who persecute you. For what reward is there for loving those who love you? Do not the heathens do the same? But you should love those who hate you, and then you shall have no enemies.",didache
3,"Abstain from fleshly and bodily lusts: If someone strikes your right cheek, turn the other also, and be perfect. If someone forces you to go one mile, go two. If someone takes your cloak, give also your coat. If someone takes from you what is yours, don't ask for it back. You really cannot.",didache
4,"Give to everyone who asks you, and don't ask for it back. The Father wants his blessings shared. Happy is the giver who lives according to this rule, for that one is guiltless. But the receiver must beware; for if one receives who has need, he is guiltless, but if one receives not having need, he shall stand trial, answering why he received and for what use. If he is found guilty he shall not escape until he pays back the last penny.",didache
5,"However, concerning this, there is a saying: ""Let your alms sweat in your hands until you know to whom to give them.”",didache
6,The second commandment of the teaching is this:,didache

14,"Don't be prone to anger, for anger leads to murder. Don't be jealous or quarrelsome or hottempered, for all these things lead to murder.",didache
15,"My child, don't be lustful, for lust leads to illicit sex. Don't be a filthy talker or allow your eyes a free reign, for these lead to adultery.",didache
16,"My child, don't observe omens, since it leads to idolatry. Don't be an enchanter, or an astrologer, or a purifier, or be willing to see or hear about these things, for these all lead to idolatry.",didache
17,"My child, don't be a liar, since a lie leads to theft. Don't love money or seek glory, for these things lead to thievery.",didache

32,"Do not give orders to your servants when you are angry, for they hope in the same God, and they may lose the fear of God, who is over both of you. God is surely not coming to call on us according to our outward appearance or station in life, but to them whom the Spirit has prepared.",didache

38,"The way of death is the way of those who persecute the good, hate the truth, love lies, and do not understand the reward for righteousness. They do not cleave to good or righteous judgment; they do not watch for what is good, but for what is evil. They are strangers to meekness and patience, loving vanities, pursuing revenge, without pity for the needy and oppressed. They do not know their Creator; they are murderers of children, destroyers of God's image. They turn away from those who are in need, making matters worse for those who are distressed. They are advocates for the rich, unjust judges of the poor. In a word, the way of death is full of those who are steeped in sin. Be delivered, children, from all of this!",didache
39,"See that no one leads you astray from the way of this teaching, since all other teachings train you without God.",didache
